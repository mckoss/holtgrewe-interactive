<history>
<![CDATA[Designed by engineer, Karl Theis, the Halberstädt D. II was built by the German company Halberstädter Flugzeug-Werke GmbH as well as under license by Aviatik and Hannoversche Waggonfabrik AG. 

The Halberstädt D.II entered service on the Western Front in September 1916 where it served successfully until the arrival of the higher performing Albatros and Fokker fighters in the spring of 1917. 

Once the D.II had been retired from the Western Front, Germany retained a few to use as advanced single-seat trainers, while the rest were equipped with radiators to adapt them for a desert environment. The modified D.IIs served in Turkey with various units of the Ottoman Air Force until the end of the war. The lack of significant opposition in this area contributed to the D.II's success.]]>
