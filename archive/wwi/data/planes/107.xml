<history>
<![CDATA[The Brandenburg D.I was designed by the German aeronautical engineer, Ernst Heinkel, who would later go on to head the famous aviation firm bearing his name. Although designed in Germany, all production of the D.I was carried out in Austria by two separate Austrian firms,  Phonix-Flugzeug-Werke AG and Ungarische Flugzeugfabrik AG. Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were allies during World War I, so this convergence of effort between the two countries is not totally surprising. However, historical records are unclear as to why the design and manufacture of this aircraft took place in different countries. 

Deployed exclusively by the Austro-Hungarians, the D.I was of conventional construction for a fighter of its time -wood framing throughout, with fabric covering of its wings and tail surfaces and a fuselage covered with a varnished plywood veneer. A thin metal alloy covered the forward fuselage around the engine. However, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I was unique in one aspect of its design; instead of the usual arrangement of vertical intra-wing struts and bracing wires, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I utilized a complicated single intra-wing "strut complex". The eight half struts comprising this single strut complex were joined into triangles at a central point between its wings. These triangles created the aircraft's entire intra-wing support. There were no bracing wires. The intent of this design was to eliminate the aerodynamic drag created by multiple struts and wires. 

The new machine first flew in the summer of 1916 and entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force the following autumn. From the start, the aircraft was sluggish, relatively slow, marginally maneuverable and unstable in flight. Further, its deep fuselage provided the pilot with limited visibility. Worse, it was plagued by a series of accidents which earned it the nickname, "the flying coffin". Despite these shortcomings, 122 D.Is were produced and they labored on in active combat service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force until mounting losses forced their retirement in late 1917.]]>
