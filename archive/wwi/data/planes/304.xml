<history>
<![CDATA[The Bristol F.2B, designed by Bristol's chief designer Frank Barnwell, first entered service with the Royal Flying Corps in April 1917. The aircraft served as a fighter and artillery spotter/reconnaissance aircraft. It performed so successfully that eventually all of the Royal Flying Corps reconnaissance squadrons were equipped with the aircraft. 

After the Royal Air Force was established in April 1918, the aircraft was renamed the Bristol F.2 Mk III. Production of these fighters continued for nearly a year after the conclusion of World War I. In all, 4,747 were eventually built. Some of these reconnaissance fighters continued on active duty with the RAF until the early 1930s.]]>
