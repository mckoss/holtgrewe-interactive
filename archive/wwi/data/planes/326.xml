<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the naval variant of the famous Sopwith Camel. The aircraft received the name "Camel" because of the hump-backed area of its forward fuselage, which housed its machine gun. The 2.F.1 Ship Camel differed from the land-based variant in several ways. It had an abbreviated center wing section with a correspondingly shorter lower wing. The 2.F.1 also had only one machine gun mounted in the fuselage instead of the two guns of its land-based counterpart. The Ship Camel's second machine gun was mounted atop its upper wing and fired above the propeller arc. The 2.F.1 also had a more powerful engine, was equipped with arresting gear for landing on an aircraft carrier deck and featured a detachable rear fuselage section to facilitate storage aboard ship. 

Production versions of the 2.F.1 aircraft were built by Sopwith and William Beardmore & Company, which began equipping units of the Royal Naval Air Service in the autumn of 1917. While the "Naval" Camel was also deployed from some shore-based facilities, it primarily served aboard the British aircraft carriers <i>Argus</i>, <i>Furious</i>, <i>Pegasus</i> and <i>Eagle</i>, all of which operated with the Grand Fleet. 

Given that Britain was the only World War I combatant nation to field ship-based aircraft, the 2.F.1 Camels, although fighters, faced little aerial opposition during their time at sea. Thus, their role became largely that of reconnaissance aircraft. A squadron of 2.F.1 Camels was also used to launch the first carrier strike in history when seven of the planes, launched from the HMS <i>Furious</i>, attacked the German airship base at Tondern, Germany.

Several hundred 2.F.1s were manufactured during the War and remained in active service with the British Royal Navy as carrier-borne fighters for several years after. Some, which were purchased by Canada, remained in shore based service until the late 1920s. The Sopwith 2.F.1 can justly be called the successful forerunner of all shipboard naval aircraft.]]>
