<history>
<![CDATA[The Royal Aircraft Factory (R.A.F.) B.E.2c developed from a series of experimental aircraft designed by Edward Teshmaker Busk in an effort to develop an inherently stable airplane. The first B.E.2c flew in the months immediately before the outbreak of World War I. When England entered the conflict, large orders for B.E. 2s were placed by both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service for use as reconnaissance aircraft. The numbers ordered were so enormous that production, under license, was spread among a number of British aviation companies- Bristol, Vickers, Ruston Proctor, Armstrong Whitworth and Wolseley. 

The B.E.2c was a two-seat biplane of standard wood and fabric construction. The B.E.2c had some success as a reconnaissance and bombing platform. However, the appearance of the Fokker monoplane, which was equipped with a propeller-synchronized machine gun, exploited the B.E.2's weak-points -its lack of armament and poor maneuverability. As air-to-air combat became more common, many attempts were made -mostly by the pilots- to mount machine guns on the B.E.2c. One method (modeled here) involved mounting a rear-firing Lewis gun between the cockpits. This arrangement proved particularly impractical as the observer/gunner seated in the front cockpit had to fire directly over the head of the pilot.

Losses of the aircraft became severe enough that the machines were largely withdrawn from solo reconnaissance duties and were deployed in force as bombers usually with a fighter escort. Others were deployed in Homeland Zeppelin interdiction with at least three Zeppelins having been destroyed by B.E. 2s. By late 1917 B.E. 2s had been largely replaced in all combat roles by more modern aircraft. A few labored on as trainers until the end of the War. A single World War I RAF B.E. 2c remains in existence today on display in the Imperial War Museum in London, England- the sole survivor of some 2,600 produced during the Great War.]]>
