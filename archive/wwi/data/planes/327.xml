<history>
<![CDATA[The Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter was the first British fighter to have a machine gun synchronized to fire forward through its propeller arc. Designed and built by the Sopwith Aviation Company, it acquired the name of "1 1/2 Strutter" from its characteristic W shaped cabane wing struts. Though the name was originally unofficial, the Royal Navy Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps later adopted the name after it entered common usage. 

Two variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter existed -the two-seat fighter modeled here and a single-seat light bomber. The bomber version eliminated the rear crew position in order to carry a bomb load within the machine's fuselage. A total of 1,513 of both variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter were built in Great Britain during World War I. British demand for the machines eventually exceeded the ability of its parent company to supply the needed aircraft. Other companies began to manufacture it under license, including the British firms Fairey; Morgan & Co.; Hooper; Westland; Vickers; Mann & Egerton; and Ruston & Proctor. Several French aviation companies also built both the two seat fighter and the single seat bomber version under license. A total of 4,497 of both variants were manufactured by the French, more than three times the number built by the British. 

In the spring of 1916, British fighter units in the Royal Navy Air Service began flying the 1 1/2 Strutter. Later the Royal Flying Corps also ordered the machine to use on the Western Front. However, by the close of 1916, the 1 1/2 Strutter was becoming obsolete and by the middle of 1917 most of the British machines were being withdrawn from frontline combat service. 

The French continued to employ numbers of the aircraft well into 1918 and sold some of the French-built 1 1/2 Strutters to the air forces of the United States, Russia, Belgium, Romania, Japan and Greece. Many of these foreign exported machines fulfilled training roles. By the early 1920s the outdated 1 1/2 Strutters had passed from the scene. ]]>
