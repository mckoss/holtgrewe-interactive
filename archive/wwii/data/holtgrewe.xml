<history>
<![CDATA[As monoplane fighters began to equip Royal Air Force units, it became obvious that an advanced trainer was needed to transition new young pilots from their basic elementary trainers to the high performance fighters they would be flying. To fulfill this need, the Air Ministry issued a specification for a high performance trainer. George Miles designed the "Master" in response. The new trainer was of smooth aeronautical design and was built of wood. Miles' first prototype, which first flew on June 3, 1937, was rejected by the Air Ministry, but Miles continued on with the project as a private venture. With the need for an advanced trainer becoming ever more pressing, the Royal Air Force finally placed an order in June of 1938 for the Master aircraft, which amounted to over 2 million pounds—the largest order in RAF history for a trainer. The flight characteristics of the new trainer, which came into RAF service just prior to the beginning of World War II, were quite similar to the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire [both modeled elsewhere in this collection], which were the RAF fighters of that period. All variants of the Master had an instructors' seat in the rear of the cockpit that could be raised so the instructor could look over the head of his student during flight. The machine proved to be excellent in its intended role and its performance was so outstanding that during the dark days following the fall of France when Britain was desperate for fighter aircraft, 24 Masters were modified into single seat fighters with six 0.303 inch machine guns for emergency use. However, none of these were ever used in this role. The model shows the original wing configuration. All variants had the wings clipped in 1942 to reduce stress and improve maneuverability. Including all variants, a total of over 3,200 were manufactured during World War II for use by the Royal Air Force and by Commonwealth Air Forces.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[If there is one aircraft that symbolizes British determination and spirit during World War II, it has to be the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. This fighter, along with its companion the Hawker Hurricane [modeled elsewhere in this collection], were the deciding factors in the British victory in the Battle of Britain—the air battle that saved England from a German invasion in the fall of 1940. The Spitfire fighter began as a series of civilian seaplane racing machines, culminating in the S.6B, designed by the legendary aeronautical engineer Reginald Mitchell. The S.6B won the very competitive Schneider trophy in 1931. Even with its two large floats, it was faster than any British fighter then in service. The S.6B was built around the powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Although slow to come to the decision, the Royal Air Force ordered a fighter version of the famous seaplane into production. The first such machine, which took on the soon to be famous name "Spitfire," began deployment with Royal Air Force fighter squadrons in July of 1938. The Spitfire proved to be as agile and effective as it was beautiful—many consider its airframe to be the most attractive of all time. The Spitfire underwent many modifications during its long career but none achieved the notoriety of the first version, the Mk I [modeled here]. During the Battle of Britain, Royal Air Force leaders adopted a policy of having their Spitfires engage the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection], while their Hawker Hurricanes attacked the German bombers. The strategy was successful. While the Mk Is were followed by many subsequent variants designed to fulfill many different roles, the Mk I stands out in history as the progenitor to them all.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Hawker Hurricane Mk I [modeled here] will be forever remembered for its epic role in the Battle of Britain. While the superb Supermarine Spitfire [modeled elsewhere in this collection] received the most credit and fame, Hurricanes comprised nearly two thirds of the Royal Air Force Fighter Command aircraft and accounted for the majority of its air victories during that air battle. Designed by Hawker's chief engineer Sidney Camm, the Hurricane entered service with the RAF in December of 1937. The machine represented a number of firsts for the RAF: first monoplane fighter, first fighter to carry eight machine guns, and first fighter to fly over 300 mph. When World War II broke out in September of 1939, RAF Fighter Command had 497 Hurricanes deployed in 18 squadrons. Numbers of these squadrons were immediately sent to France to support the British Expeditionary Force. Their presence had little impact on the rapid German Blitzkrieg invasion of France and during the Battle of France almost 200 Hurricane aircraft were lost. When the Battle of Britain began on August 8, 1940, the RAF had 32 squadrons equipped with Hurricanes and 19 equipped with Spitfires. The difference in the operational abilities of these two machines led Fighter Command to employ the Spitfires against the German fighters and the Hurricanes against the bombers. The plan worked very well. The Battle of Britain was won and the planned invasion of England could not be carried out by the Germans since they lacked complete control of the air. Although not appreciated at the time, this was clearly at turning point in World War II—had England been invaded and successfully taken by the Germans, the history of the war and the subsequent history of the world would have been very different. Although German air raids continued, September 15, 1940, has come to be called "Battle of Britain Day," for it was the turning point of the air battle that changed world history. The Hawker Hurricane was a very major part of that battle.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Nakajima in response to a 1938 Japanese Imperial Army specification for a new high performance fighter. Among the requirements for the machine was that it have a very high speed and a rapid rate of climb. These features were emphasized rather than maneuverability and range, which had been prime requirements for all previous Japanese fighters. At the same time Nakajima developed the Ki-44 [Allied code-named "Tojo"], the company was also developing the Nakajima Ki-43 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. In essence, Nakajima Aircraft was designing two fighters for the same specification, both were produced, and both became major components of the Japanese fighter force. The first Ki-44 flew in August of 1940 but its trials were disappointing—the machine could not reach the desired specified speeds. Aerodynamic modifications and a new more powerful engine were adopted, which achieved the needed performance. Production Ki-44s began equipping operational fighter units in September of 1942. Japanese pilots were slow to accept the new fighter, not liking its high landing speed and lack of maneuverability, but with time its acceptance improved and the Ki-44 was in active combat for the remainder of the war. It was extensively employed in the last year of the war in the role of interceptor attacking the formations of American B-29s [modeled elsewhere in this collection] that were bombing Japan almost daily. From January 1942 to December 1944 1,225 Ki-44s were produced in two variants.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was the only World War II fighter entirely designed and built by Romania. It was produced by the Romanian aircraft company Industria Aeronautică Română and was developed from experience gained by the firm building, under license, the Polish PZL P.24 fighter. The machine was distinctive in appearance by its fuselage, having a very long nose forward of the cockpit. It first flew in April of 1939 and, after several modifications and changes to both airframe and power plant, it was placed into production. The first series aircraft came off the assembly line in 1941, well after the beginning of World War II. During its production run, several different variants of the IAR 80 were produced. They varied mainly in the armament they carried. The aircraft was extensively involved in the European air war, especially during the last two years of the war, in protecting the Romanian Ploieşti oil fields from Allied bombing. These vital oil fields were the only readily available source of petroleum for the European Axis powers during the war. A total of 137 IAR fighters were built at their Brasov, Romania, plant before the German controlled factory was ordered to convert to the production of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Overall, the machine was an adequate, if not an outstanding, fighter.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Recognizing the effectiveness of fighters with liquid cooled inline engines that were currently being manufactured in Europe, the Curtiss-Wright Corporation decided to install such a power plant in the air frame of their P-36 Hawk aircraft. The P-40 was thus born and first flew in October of 1938. The P-40 was an all metal machine with landing gear which turned 90 degrees as they retracted into their wing wells. Its trials went extremely well and the United States Army Air Force placed a 13 million-dollar order for 524 P-40s—the largest single order for fighter aircraft in U.S. history. The P-40s began equipping Army Air Force units in late 1940. When Japan attacked the United States in December of 1941, there were 107 P-40s in service in the Philippines alone but, unfortunately, the surprise of the Japanese was such that the vast majority of these were destroyed on the ground. Wartime production was vastly increased and the P-40 became the U.S. Army fighter aircraft that was available in the greatest numbers in the early months of the war. New improved variants were produced, many of which were sent to Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war, a group of American flyers went to China and formed the American Volunteer Group under the leadership of General Clair L. Chennault and began flying the P-40B Tomahawk fighters against the Japanese. Used to facing only obsolete biplane fighters, the Japanese were shocked when the "Flying Tigers" began shooting down their bombers in large numbers with their Tomahawks. The P-40 aircraft had a radiator beneath its propeller hub, which made it ideal for painting on the sharks teeth nose art. This paint scheme, which originated with the British Forces in Africa, became identified with the American Volunteer Group. Indeed, P-40s of other air force units copied the similar shark tooth scheme, which became almost symbolic of this type of aircraft. As the war progressed, new more effective fighters gradually replaced the P-40 in front line fighter units, but the P-40 remained in combat in non-European theaters where they faced fighters of lesser quality. Some P-40s continued in service until the end of the war. Starting in March of 1942, the P-40B Flying Tiger losses were being replaced by P-40Es. On July 4, 1942, the AVG was absorbed back into the US Army Air Forces.]]>

<![CDATA[This biplane fighter did not fly until 1939, just weeks before the out breaks of World War II. It is difficult to understand why Italian military leaders would produce a biplane fighter at a time when that type of aircraft was clearly obsolete. Yet, they put the CR.42 into service just as the war began and it was the last biplane fighter built by any of the combatants of World War II. The CR.42 was developed from the older CR.32 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]; it had the same configuration of Warren type between wing struts as did the CR 32, and the CR.42 retained much of the construction techniques of its predecessor. The Regia Aeronautica had 330 CR.42s in service when Italy entered the war. The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was now the ally of Hitler's Germany and wanting to show his support, he dispatched 50 of his new CR.42 Falcos to Belgium where they joined the Luftwaffe in fighting the British Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. The Falcos suffered heavy losses at the hands of the British Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. One of these Fiat CR.42 Falcos, which took part in the Battle of Britain, is now on permanent display in the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon, England. The CR.42 was deployed in the greatest numbers in the Italian, Greek, Middle East, and North African campaigns, where they faired better against British fighters like the biplane Gloster Gladiator. However, when British Hurricanes arrived in these areas, the CR.42s losses mounted. Despite being obviously out-classed by their Allied fighter counterparts, CR.42s labored on until the Italian Armistice in September 1943—by then almost all the machines had been retired or destroyed.]]>

<![CDATA[The Fiat CR.32 was one of the best fighters in the world when it was first introduced in the early 1930s. It was of fabric-covered light-metal alloy and steel tubular construction with a fixed landing gear with wheel covers. The CR.32 first saw action when deployed with the Italian Aviazione Legionaria during the Spanish Civil War, where the biplane fighter gave excellent performance and became the back bone of the Nationalist fighter force. However, by the entry of Italy into World War II, the CR.32 was obsolete compared to its competing more modern monoplane fighters and was no match for them in combat. In light of these realities, the Regia Aeronautica withdrew the CR.32s to Ethiopia and Italy's occupied areas of East Africa where there was little or no British fighter opposition. The CR.32s labored on in these areas until the Italian capitulation in September of 1943, when the machines were withdrawn as useless. A total of 1,211 CR.32s were produced in its different variants. In its time, the little biplane fighter was a winner, but by World War II its time had passed.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[If there was a single aircraft that symbolized the Japanese war effort in the Pacific theater during World War II, it has to be the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M "Zero." During the early years of that conflict, the machine seemed invincible and clearly out-classed any fighter in Allied service. It ravaged all that faced it. The A6M [Allied code-named "Zeke"] was a successor to the A5M [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was designed by Jiro Horikoshi, Mitsubishi's chief design engineer, in response to a 1937 specification from the Japanese Imperial Navy for a new fighter. The first prototype took to the air on April 1, 1939, and was immediately recognized as a profound success exceeding all the Navy's specifications. It was placed into rapid production. At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, in which the Zero took part, the Japanese Navy had 328 of these fighters in front line service, many aboard its aircraft carriers. Although officially code-named Zeke, Allied personnel uniformly called the machine a "Zero" throughout the entire war. The invincibility enjoyed by the Zero began to fade as improved Allied fighters arrived on the scene. One of the Zero's failings was its lack of protective armor for its fuel tanks and for its pilot. Any hit in these areas meant the machines would burst into flames or the pilot would be mortally wounded or killed. Japanese engineers made modifications to the Zero in attempts to make the machine more competitive with the new modern Allied fighters. These efforts achieved some success, but the Zero remained essentially unchanged throughout the entire war as its opposite Allied aircraft became more and more advanced and improved. In the end, the once great Zero was totally out-classed and vulnerable in clashes with Allied fighters. Many Zeros ended their careers in the undignified role of suicide bomber.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The importance of the Bf 109 fighter to the Germans in World War II can best be measured by the fact that between 1935 and 1945, including all of its many variants, no fewer than 35,000 were produced—probably an all time world record for any single aircraft type. The Bf 109 project began in 1934 when Willy Messerschmitt and his colleague Walter Rethel took the Bf 108 civilian aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and modified it into a single-seat, all-metal low wing monoplane fighter which was destined to be one of the epic fighting machines of all time. Designed and built to satisfy a German government specification for a new high performance fighter for the new Luftwaffe, it first flew in October of 1935. It was immediately recognized as being a very superior machine. After some modifications, the Bf 109 went into production in February of 1937. It received its baptism of fire in the Spanish Civil War, where it single handedly established a new standard by which all current and future fighters of the world would be judged. The Bf 109 simply out-classed all other fighters of the world at the time. Production continued before and throughout World War II, turning out a huge number of variants, and it did not cease until the Germans surrendered in May of 1945, nearly a decade after Bf 109 production began.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Bf 109 for the E-7 [modeled here] was a continuation in the evolution of this world famous fighter and the last large production version prior to major aerodynamic upgrades. Later versions of the Bf 109 were the "F" series and the "G" or "Gustav" series, which utilized the more powerful DB 605 engine. The F and G series differed from its predecessors by having a more powerful engine, different armament, and the obvious external difference of a much larger propeller hub. These changes made the machine faster but came at a price—the G was less maneuverable and less agile. However, it was produced and flown in the largest numbers of any Bf 109 variant. Numbers of the Gs were fitted with pressurized cockpits for high altitude combat. This evolution finally resulted in the Bf 109 K series, the last production version. Only a few Ks reached operational units, although about 700 were built. The G variants began equipping Luftwaffe fighter units in the summer of 1942, when the advent of the more modern British Supermarine Spitfires and American P-51 Mustangs [both modeled elsewhere in this collection] had placed the Bf 109 in the position of no longer being the best fighter in the air. Further, the title of "best" German fighter, by the time of the appearance of the G, had been captured by the improving variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Nonetheless, the G variants, of which there were 14, remained in production and in front line service until the very end of the European war in May of 1945. In total, all Bf 109 production was in excess of 33,000 aircraft, second only to the Soviet Il-2 Shturmovik series as the most produced aircraft in history. Performance data is provided for the E-7 variant.]]>

<![CDATA[Aside from the British Supermarine Spitfire [modeled elsewhere in this collection], no fighter deployed in World War II looked more aggressive than the Fw 190. The first prototype of the aircraft was flown on June 1, 1939—a mere 3 months before the beginning of World War II. The fighter was rapidly put into production and, by August 1942, the Luftwaffe had 200 in service where they were employed entirely in the west against the British. When first introduced, the Fw 190 had a substantial advantage against the British Spitfire Mk V [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which was the best fighter of the Royal Air Force at that time. It was not until the later Marks of the Spitfire and the American P-51 and P-47 fighters [both modeled elsewhere in this collection] began operation that the Allies achieved equality with this fine German fighter. In very late 1942, the Fw 190 was sent to the Soviet front where they also proved to be superior to any Soviet fighter. A large number of Fw 190 variants were manufactured during the war with changes in power plant and armament. These were in the form of fighter bombers, ground attack aircraft, and even a two-seat training version. The prototype of this model was attached to the above listed unit of the Luftwaffe and was deployed in the defense of the Reich in the late autumn of 1944. Overall, the Fw 190 was one of the finest fighters of World War II.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The introduction of the Me 262 marked the beginning of the era of jet powered military aircraft and the beginning of the end of propeller driven military aircraft. The Me 262 was the operational combat machine in which the jet engine made its debut. The Me 262 project was begun by Messerschmitt engineers in 1938, but the understandable complexities of this revolutionary aircraft and its jet propulsion power plants were such that the first prototype did not complete its initial successful test flight until July 18,1942. However, it was not until April of 1944 that production models were available to combat units. Their appearance in the skies over Europe was a severe shock to the Allies who had no aircraft that was a match for the speed of the Me 262. Allied fighters could only destroy the Me 262 when it was in the vulnerable position of either taking off or landing, but the Allies were fortunate that the deployment of the new jet was not managed well. A total of 1,430 were manufactured in the final days of the war but their effectiveness was diluted by continuous German efforts to utilize the new machine in many varied roles and in many variations rather than employing it in the role for which it was intended—a high performance fighter/interceptor. In any case, they were too few and too late but had they been available to the Luftwaffe earlier and in greater numbers, it might well have been a vastly different European air war.]]>

<comments><![CDATA[Model Builder's Comments: Both German and Allied engineers and their aircraft developers recognized the importance of jet propulsion as an alternative to propeller power, which had been improved to the maximum of its possible efficiency. In the race to be the first to place a jet aircraft into operational service, the Germans won with the Me 262. The only operational Allied jet aircraft of WWII, the British Gloster Meteor, entered service in July 1944, 3 months after the arrival of the Me 262. All other Allied jets remained in developmental status, including the United States' Bell Airacomet, its first jet fighter. It is worth noting that the only two jet fighters of WWII, one German and one British, never met in combat.]]></comments>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed in desperation. The Luftwaffe needed a high performance interceptor to counter the huge flights of American and British bombers that were destroying German's industry and rendering it unable to wage war. The German High Command turned to what was left of its aircraft industry with what seemed to be an impossible request. The mission was to build a fast fighter/interceptor, to make it of wood and other non-essential materials, design and begin building it in no more than 3 months, and have it be of simple enough construction that a force of unskilled laborers could manufacture the machine—a tall order. But, Heinkel did it! Given the difficulty in design of jet engines, which the new fighter would have to use to meet the specifications, Heinkel used in their design the existing BMW turbojet engine. Constant Allied bombing forced the construction of the new jet fighters under ground into old salt mines in Germany and Austria. Entire new factories were built, forced labor was used, but the 3 month deadline for the first machines to fly was met. However, early test flights were attended with several spectacular crashes. Undaunted, production pressed on in the salt mines. As the project advanced forward, a very serious problem became obvious—a problem apart from the obvious shortage of engines, materials and skilled workers. The new He 162 was a "hot," high performance machine that required great pilot skill to manage. Germany had run out of pilots who were qualified to fly such a machine. Worse, because of the bombing of its refineries and oil fields, Germany had run out of fuel. The production of 4,000 He 162s per month had been planed. A total of only 116 completed Salamanders came off the assembly lines before Germany's surrender in May of 1945. The Salamander never reached combat.]]>

<![CDATA[The United States Navy realized that the era of the carrier-based biplane was coming to an end and in 1936 issued a specification for a new monoplane fighter. The Brewster Company responded with a new all-metal monoplane with retractable landing gear, wing flaps, and enclosed cockpit. The prototype of this stubby and tubby new machine first flew in December of 1937. Delivery of the new fighter to Navy units began in June of 1939, the first going to Navy fighter squadron VF-3 stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga. Numbers of the new Buffalos were also supplied to Finland, which was then fighting off an invasion from the Soviet Union. The Finns made good use of the machines and came to regard them very highly. United States Marine Corps fighter plane units were also given an improved version of the Buffalo and one such unit, VMF-221, was stationed on Midway Island when it was attacked by the Japanese on June 4, 1942, just 6 months after the Pearl Harbor attack. In this epic battle which turned the course of the Pacific war, Marine pilots in their stubby Buffalo fighters fought bravely, but their over weight, unstable, and poorly maneuverable fighters were no match for the fast and agile Japanese Zeros. The Buffalos were mauled. Aside from its use in Finland, the Buffalo F2A was a failure and was quickly replaced aboard American aircraft carriers and on land-based facilities by the Grumman F4F Wildcat [modeled elsewhere in this collection].]]>

The machine began equipping French fighter units in October of 1939, just weeks after the beginning of World War II. Following the French capitulation in June of 1940, the occupying Germans took over numbers of MB.152s for their use—mainly as trainers. Other machines were taken over by the Vichy French government for their Air Force, the Armée de l'Air de l'Armistice. The largest numbers were deployed for use in former French African Colonies.]]>

<![CDATA[The Dewoitine Company developed the D.520 in response to a specification by the Ministère de l'Air in April of 1938 for a new fighter for the Armée de l'Air. The new beautiful machine was of low-wing all-metal construction and was a marked departure from the long line of previous Dewoitine fighter designs. The D.520 had much better performance and heavier armament than its predecessors. The first prototype flew on October 2, 1938. The performance was considered excellent and production orders were placed by the Ministère de l'Air for 200 of the new fighters. Soon after, an additional 510 were ordered. Flight trials continued during November and December of 1939 and production aircraft began equipping the Armée de l'Air in early 1940, but only 36 had been delivered by May 1940 when Germany invaded France. At the time of the French capitulation to Germany in June 1940, the machines were still being produced and that production continued with German authorization. Vichy France also continued to manufacture the D.520 completing 478 of them before Germany subsequently occupied the Vichy area of Southern France. The Germans captured 246 D.520s during this occupation to which were added an additional 192 completed in Vichy France after the German occupation. Many of these Vichy built D.520s were transferred by Germany to its allies Italy, Bulgaria, and Romania. A few D.520s were even used by the Luftwaffe. The D.520 was, without question, the best French fighter of World War II. Had it been available in larger numbers the fate of the Armée de l'Air during the Battle of France might have been very different.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The P-38 was the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's first military aircraft—and what an aircraft it was, for when it first flew on January 27, 1939, the P-38 Lightning was a totally revolutionary machine. It was designed in response to a 1937 United States Army Air Force specification for a new long-range high performance fighter. Lockheed's new machine came from the so-called "skunk works" division of Lockheed. This was a division under the direction of H. L. Hibbard and the legendary Clarence L. "Kelly" Johnson, a division which was destined over the next decades to design and build some of the world's finest military aircraft. They produced a machine that looked nothing like any existing contemporary fighter. It was an all metal, twin boom, twin engine, long-range fighter with a tricycle landing gear and it carried a powerful armament. The machine was immediately recognized as an outstanding aircraft. Some developmental revisions had been required before production P-38s began equipping Army Air Force fighter units in August of 1941. The P-38 was subsequently manufactured in a large number of variants designed for different uses: fighter, fighter-bomber, reconnaissance, and photoreconnaissance. The "J" fighter version [modeled here] was produced in the greatest numbers during the war. The P-38 was used in virtually every theater of action in which the United States was involved, but the safety of its twin engine format and its long range made it ideal for operations in the Pacific, where long flights over water were the norm. Perhaps the P-38's most famous action was when a group of them ambushed the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M "Betty" bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection] carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, shooting it down and killing him. The operation was made possible because the Americans had broken the Japanese naval code and knew the admiral's route and scheduled times of flight. The P-38 was one of the finest fighters of World War II as confirmed by the fact that America's three top scoring combat aces of World War II all flew the P-38 when establishing their records.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was in the series of fighters designed in 1929 by Zygmunt Puławski of the Polish aircraft firm Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze [PZL] and was the successor to the P.1, the P.7 and P.11 [the latter modeled elsewhere in this collection]. These machines witnessed a transition from biplane fighters to a mono-wing configuration. The first P.24 flew in May of 1933. In 1934, the high gull wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear set a new world aviation speed record of 257 mph in level flight. At the time, it was regarded as the best fighter aircraft in the world, based on its all metal construction, speed, performance, and armament. In addition to equipping fighter units of the Polish Air Force, the machine was sold to the air forces of Greece and Bulgaria. The P.24 in this collection is modeled after a Bulgarian fighter. The P.24 was also built under license by Turkey and Romania with additional sales to Finland, Estonia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. It was, in fact, an international fighter of the Eastern European nations. In September of 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, these aircraft were very much in active service. While the P.24 had been a world-class fighter in the mid 1930s, by the beginning of World War II, it was becoming obsolete and proved to be no match for modern German fighters like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Despite being out-dated, the P.24 saw extensive action in the early days of World War II with the air forces of all the above nations except Turkey, which remained neutral. Its Polish service was especially outstanding—the P.24 was effectively flown by numerous brave Polish airmen and was credited with shooting down numbers of German aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was the first piloted aircraft in the world to be powered by a rocket. Its design and production were the result of the continuous and devastating bombing of German industry. The Luftwaffe, in a desperate effort to stem the damage, turned to Messerschmitt requesting a new fighter/interceptor. The Me 163 was, as a matter of fact, the product of two German engineers—Alexander Lippisch, a glider expert and Helmuth Walter, a rocket engine expert. The Me 163 was a rocket powered glider that used its limited propulsion for only a very few minutes to achieve altitude on take off, for attack, for carrying out escape maneuvers, and for landing. In total, the Me 163 had only 7 minutes of fueled flight. To conserve weight and to ensure its aerodynamic profile, the machine took off on a dolly that fell away from the fuselage on ascent. Upon landing, the Me 163 descended on a skid on the underside of its fuselage. On its maiden flight, the new rocket plane broke the existing world speed record by over 100 mph. The first deliveries to operational Luftwaffe units began in May of 1944. The first Allied encounter with the Me 163 was on July 28, 1944. While the speed of the Komet was dazzling and rendered it immune from Allied defensive fire, it was so fast that in attacking it had only a 3 second interval in which to fire its weapons before it was past its target. But the chief problem with the Me 163 was in finding pilots who could fly the extremely "hot" aircraft. Years of war had decimated the ranks of high quality Luftwaffe pilots. A second problem was the combustible liquid fuel used in the Me 163. The two components that were used would ignite and explode on contact. There were numerous fires and explosions during the fueling of these little machines. Overall, while they were revolutionary, the fastest aircraft of World War II, and gave a very significant shock to the Allied airman seeing them streak by for the first time, they had no significant impact on the war.]]>

<![CDATA[This fighter was a direct descendant in the line of aircraft designed by Zygmunt Puławski and built by the Polish aircraft firm Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze [PZL]. The PZL P.11 was the successor to the PZL P.7 in this linage and was very similar in external appearance. The difference was the incorporation of a more powerful engine and fuselage changes needed to accommodate the larger power plant. The P.11 retained the high gull wing and fixed landing gear configuration of the older P.7. The P.11c variant [modeled here] first flew in 1933. These machines became the principle fighter in the Polish Air Force in the late 1930s. When Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, the P.11 remained Poland's chief fighter aircraft equipping twelve of its fighter squadrons. Despite being obsolete and the fact very few had radios, P.11s shot down 126 German aircraft for a loss of but 114 of its own number during the brief German-Polish conflict. This is largely credited to the expert and brave flying of the Polish airmen.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The F4F was the first United States naval monoplane fighter and was a member of the long lineage of fighter aircraft designed and built by Grumman. It first flew on September 2, 1937, and after faults in design were corrected, it entered production in August of 1939. Although known as Grumman Wildcats, the majority were not built by Grumman but rather by the eastern Division of General Motors and were designated the FM-2. Over 7,800 F4Fs and FM-2s were produced during the war. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, bringing the United States into World War II, the Wildcat was the principal U.S. carrier fighter. During the early days of the Pacific War, not many American pilots could expect to win in combat against Japanese Zero fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection], given that the Japanese machines were much more agile than the F4F. However, the F4F was rugged, could stand a great deal of battle damage, had self sealing fuel tanks, and was able to return it its carrier after sustaining considerable trauma; unlike the Zero which had no armor and when hit would often disintegrate. With experience and improved tactics like the "Thach Weave," an aerial combat strategy devised by Lt. Cdr. J.S. Thach, the Wildcats scored many victories over Japanese aircraft. They were the backbone of U.S. carrier fighter units during the first two years of the Pacific War. Another heroic Wildcat pilot, "Butch" O'Hare, not only won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his exploits in the Wildcat, but also had the Chicago airport named after him. Wildcats were gradually replaced by Grumman F6F Hellcats [modeled elsewhere in this collection] beginning in August of 1943. Over all, the stubby little fighter made a huge contribution in the war against the Japanese.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The North American Mustang in its early versions such as the "B" [modeled elsewhere in this collection] had been a huge success. It was out-performing its German rivals. However, it had one fault—limited backward visibility. This had been only partly improved by the British placement of a "Malcolm Hood," a bubble shaped canopy that did offer better rear vision. Nevertheless, pilots still complained about poor visibility. The "D" series of the Mustang was designed to correct this fault in an otherwise excellent aircraft. A completely glazed bubble-shaped drop canopy was designed for the new Mustang, which allowed for 360° pilot vision. A modification to the fuselage was required to accommodate this new canopy, a forward fin was added to the front of the rudder. Other revisions included a more powerful engine and the addition of two more machines guns. Otherwise, the Mustang retained its basic form. A total of 7,596 of these D variants were built—the largest number of any Mustang type. The alterations to an already outstanding aircraft created one of the truly suburb fighters of World War II. With auxiliary drop fuel tanks, the P-51D could escort American bombers over the entirety of Germany protecting them from German fighter attack. The presence of the P-51D on these long missions totally changed the course of the European air war in the favor of the Allies. German industry could be pounded with impunity with a marked reduction in bomber losses. Without question, this single event was a major factor in the destruction of Germany's ability to wage war and in the final Allied victory in World War II. The last mission of a P-51D in World War II was escorting American bombers over Osaka, Japan, on August 14, 1945—the day before the Japanese surrender. In the European theater alone, the Mustang flew some 213,873 missions and destroyed an estimated 4,950 enemy aircraft, many on the ground. Following the war the Mustang remained on in Untied States Air Force service through the Korean war and until it was replaced by jet fighters. It remained in service with the air forces of some 50 other countries well into the 1960s. It continues to fly in the 21st Century with sport aviators.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Mustang fighter was the finest American fighter of World War II. Most aviation historians would not argue with that statement. They might if the statement were to include all fighters of the war. In any case, it was certainly one of the best. The beginning of the Mustang story is remarkable. In 1940, the British purchasing commission was desperate for fighter aircraft and approached the North American Aviation company to build the American Curtiss P-40 under license. North American's president James "Dutch" Kindelberger responded by saying he could build a better machine. The British agreed, but placed the stipulation that the project be completed in just 120 days. North American beat the deadline by 3 days and produced an astonishing machine. Mustangs began arriving in England in November of 1941. Their performance was good but at altitude they could not rival the Messerschmitt Bf 109 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Enterprising British aeronautical engineers in October of 1942 decided to replace the Mustang's American Allison engines with the superb Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, which was powering the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The marriage was pure magic and created one of the finest fighters in World War II, especially at altitude. The Merlin-powered Mustang eclipsed any German fighter then in action. The "B" variant modeled here has another British modification, the Malcolm canopy, a bubble-like cockpit cover that gave the pilot better all around vision. Numerous variants of the Mustang were built during the war culminating in over 15,000 of all types. After World War II, Mustangs remained in United States Air Force service through the Korean War and into the mid 1950s. They served foreign air forces into the late 1960s. Numbers of Mustangs are still flying in the 21st Century with civilian sport fliers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Thunderbolt was the largest and heaviest fighter aircraft of World War II. Designed by Alexander Kartveli, Republic Aviation Company's chief engineer, it was the culmination of an evolution which began with the Seversky P-35 and continued through the unsuccessful P-43 Lancer [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Built around the huge Pratt & Whitney R-2800, the most powerful engine available at the time, its complexities [including new turbochargers and exhaust systems] were considerable and required space which kept the wing attachments well above the bottom of the fuselage. The landing gear thus had to be long to allow the 12 foot 2 inch four bladed propeller to clear the ground during takeoff. This, in turn, meant that the four 50 caliber machine guns in each wing would have to be rather far outboard in order to clear the landing gear wells. Despite these and other problems, the machine became one of the great fighters of WWII. It was not only a fighter [with the use of drop tanks] capable of escorting bombers over Germany, but it was also the Unites States' best ground attack aircraft during the last years of the war. Its size and weight [later models weighed up to 20,700 pounds] lead to its nickname "the jug" for Juggernaut. It was manufactured in several variants from 1940 through 1945 with a total of over 15,000 being produced—the largest number of any American fighter during the war.]]>

<![CDATA[The evolution and development of the Thunderbolt aircraft is described elsewhere in this collection in the discussion of the model of the Republic P-47D Razorback. Thunderbolts were deployed in active service in both the European and the Pacific theaters of operation and were supplied to the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Free French Air Forces. While the P-47D "Razorbacks" were very successful machines, pilot visibility was less than perfect. The restricted rear vision was not adequately compensated by the rear view mirrors. To improve visibility from the cockpit later P-47Ds were given a tear drop canopy allowing for 360° vision. This modification was very well received by Thunderbolt pilots and the new versions came to be called "Bubble Tops." Between 1942 and late 1945 over 15,600 P-47s of all variants were manufactured—the largest of any American fighter during the war. After World War II, large numbers of P-47s remained in active service for many years in the air forces of several nations of the world.]]>

<comments><![CDATA[Model Builder's Comments: During World War II, virtually all the combatant nations painted their aircraft in a variety of camouflage schemes. However, in the last years of the war the United States discontinued painting many of its machines. Paint added weight and created wind resistance thus slowing the aircraft and consuming more aviation fuel. The value of camouflage, if any, was deemed by the U.S. Army Air Force to not be worth the sacrifice. Thus many late United States aircraft remained unpainted and left the factory with a highly reflective polished aluminum finish as was the case with the prototype of this model.]]></comments>

<history>
<![CDATA[Based upon its performance and numbers in service, many World War II aviation historians regard this aircraft to be the finest Italian fighter that took part in the conflict. It was the direct descendant of the Macchi M.C.200 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and it had the same designer, Mario Castaldi. First flying on August 10, 1940, it was produced from May 1941 until August 1943 just prior to the Italian capitulation to the Allies. During this time a total of 1,100 were built. The sleek appearing M.C.202 established a departure from previous Italian aircraft design, which had traditionally used radial engines. The Aerodynamic limitations imposed by a massive radial engine, no matter how powerful, were obvious. The M.C.202s success was assured when the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid cooled inline engines became available. Built under license by Fiat and Alfa Romeo, these power plants proved to be the secret to the new Italian fighter's success along with their allowing for a beautifully aerodynamic airframe. Its chief fault, like the M.C.200 before it, was the light armament of only two machine guns. M.C.202s saw action on all Italian battlefronts and were competitive with the Allied fighters they had to confront except for their poor armament. Following the Italian armistice in September of 1943, M.C.202s then flew on both sides of the continuing war—for the Cobelligerent Air Force alongside the Allies and for the Repubblica Sociale Italiana alongside Germany.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Grumman F6F was the most important single United States fighter aircraft of the Pacific War. The Hellcat was next in the linage of Grumman fighters designed and built for the United States Navy. It replaced the Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which had been the main U.S. Naval fighter during the first two years of the war. The Hellcat was larger and faster than the Wildcat and was surprisingly agile for its size. The presence of the F6F clearly gave the air advantage to America after its combat debut on missions in the Marcus Islands on August 31, 1943. Hellcat pilots were credited with 4,947 enemy aircraft destroyed in the Pacific Theater. Three hundred seven American Fighter Aces in WWII had some or all of their victories in the F6F. A total of over 6,000 Axis aircraft were destroyed in all theaters of the war by carrier- and land-based U.S. and British Hellcats. The F6F proved to be a fine machine with few faults. Perhaps the only one was that its cockpit never had a bubble canopy, providing the Hellcat pilot with a poor view to the rear. From the time of its first flight on June 26, 1942, until production ceased on November 16, 1945, some 12,275 F6Fs of all variants were manufactured. The F6F also served with the Fleet Air Arm flying from British Royal Navy aircraft carriers. Hellcats remained in active U.S. Navy service for several years after the war and with the Naval Air Services of France, Argentina, and Uruguay into the 1960s.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed by Mitsubishi in response to a Japanese Imperial Navy specification issued in 1938 for a land-based high-performance fighter that would complement the Mitsubishi A6M Zero [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Although the design was completed in a relatively short time, it was almost four years before the J2M [Allied code-named "Jack"] first flew. The delay was multi-factorial. The chief reason was the Mitsubishi company's concentration on the Zero, which was then in mass production. There was trouble from the flight of the first J2M prototype—the machine's stability was rough and, worse, its power plant was not reliable. Many modifications and a new engine were required. After many revisions, the fighter finally went into production in December of 1942, but two inexplicable crashes temporarily stopped production until it was discovered that a tail wheel assembly was interfering with control cables. Once corrected, production resumed with a total of 476 of all variants being built. Engine problems plagued the J2M throughout its entire career and prevented it from becoming an outstanding fighter. However, they remained in front line service until the very end of the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was designed by Dr. Erich Schatzki and followed the Fokker construction techniques of the time: tubular steel frame with metal skin in the forward fuselage and fabric in the rear. Development of the Fokker D.XXI was in response to a Royal Netherlands Indies Army specification for a new fighter. It was a low wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear. The machine made its maiden flight on February 25, 1936. Production orders were placed by the Netherlands and Finnish governments. Additional Fokker D.XXIs were built under license in Finland and Spain with the latter aircraft taking part in the Spanish Civil War. Numbers of Fokker D.XXIs were operational with the Netherlands Air Force at the outbreak of World War II. With the German invasion of Holland in early May of 1940, the Fokker D.XXIs did poorly against the more modern German fighters. Few of the Dutch machines survived the war. Some of the Finnish machines did survive the Finnish-Soviet conflict.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was the first monoplane fighter in the Japanese Imperial Army. It was designed and built in response to a specification issued in 1934. When creating the Ki-27, the Nakajima engineers placed emphasis on agility and maneuverability, properties that were present in the older biplanes. The Ki-27 was, in a sense, a transition between biplanes and the newer monoplane configuration. The landing gear did not retract and the aircraft did not have self-sealing tanks or armor. Yet, the old concept of the fighter pilot being able to out-maneuver his opponent remained up most in the designers' minds. The first production Ki-27s [Allied code-named "Nate"] began equipping operational fighter units of the Japanese Imperial Army in December of 1937. They saw first combat in China in March of 1938 with excellent performance. Production of the Ki-27 continued through 1942 despite the beginning of production of the Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the Ki-27's successor. In total, from 1937 until the end of the production run 3,399 were built. From 1941 on, the Ki-27s were gradually withdrawn from fighter squadrons given the arrival in the Pacific theater of modern Allied fighters, with which the Nates could not compete. They ended their careers as trainers, target tugs and finally as suicide Kamikaze bombers loaded with 1,250 pounds (567 kg) of explosives.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Following a trend begun in Europe for the development of large, long-range, heavy two-engine fighters, the Imperial Japanese Army in 1937 issued a specification for such a machine for its Air Force. The Kawasaki company and its chief engineer, Takeo Doi, responded with the Ki-45. Design difficulties delayed its first flight until January 1939. Multiple problems were present in the new machine, requiring major modifications in both its airframe and its power plants. After much work, the first production Ki-45s [Allied code-named "Nick"] began equipping operational squadrons in August of 1942. The fighter version of the aircraft, the Ki-45 Kai A did not have outstanding performance. The Ki-45 Kai B found roles as ground attack aircraft and anti-shipping aircraft. As the United States B-29 bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection] began bombing Japanese cities and industry at night, numbers of Ki-45s were converted into night fighters as Ki-45 KAIcs [modeled here]. When production ended in July 1945, a total of 1,691 were manufactured excluding prototypes. The overall performance of the machine could, at best, be called modest. It never fulfilled its intended role as a heavy fighter. It did better as a night fighter and ground attack aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The design and production of this two-engine heavy fighter was a real change of pace for the Westland Company, which had previously built only biplanes and the staid Lysander reconnaissance monoplane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Westland built the Whirlwind in response to a 1938 Air Ministry specification for a new long-range fighter. The entire project was kept in secrecy, even after the first delivery of the new Whirlwinds to RAF Squadron 263, based at Drem, England. Early experience with the fighter revealed many faults, mainly with its engines, the Rolls-Royce Peregrines. Delivery of the aircraft to the RAF was slow largely due to engine problems. The Whirlwind had good performance at lower altitudes but its performance suffered at high altitudes. Furthermore, it was a difficult machine to fly and its high landing speed limited the number of airfields that could handle the fighter. Given these shortcomings, the original order for 400 machines was cut to 112. Whirlwinds flew with only two squadrons and were all removed from service in June of 1943. What initially looked like a fine aircraft on paper, proved to be a very large disappointment.]]>

<![CDATA[In 1940, Aleksandr Yakolev's design bureau started an update to the Yak-1 (I-26) with an all-metal aircraft called the Yak-3 (I-30). Two prototypes were completed but performed poorly even after attempts to improve installed engine performance. The Yak-3 (I-30) program was discontinued in late summer 1941. The Red Air Force requested a new high performance fighter to be designed and built by the State Industries Aviation Bureau. The Yak-3 designation was reassigned to this new program. The new Yakovlev Yak-3 (II) project began in 1941 with the intent of producing a small fast fighter with excellent maneuverability. The new aircraft was, however, very slow in arriving on the scene due to severe problems obtaining and fitting a suitable engine. The first production Yak-3s did not reach operational units of the Red Air Force until July of 1944, just 10 months before the end of the European war. The Yak-3's performance was excellent, especially at high altitudes where it was as good as any fighter then in existence. While its production was slow to start, 4,848 Yak-3 aircraft had been built by Soviet industry prior to the German surrender in May, 1945. The Yak-3 was a suburb fighter. It remained in Soviet service for several years after the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Mark XVI Spitfire is basically a Mark IX Spitfire equipped with an American Packard-built Merlin 266 engine instead of the equivalent Rolls Royce-built Merlin 66. The Merlin 66 and 266 engines were low altitude versions of the Merlin 61 engine. Hence, the LF designation on aircraft so equipped. It has been said by aviation authorities that the Spitfire's elliptically curved graceful wing was the most beautiful ever put on an airplane. If this is the case, that beauty was compromised when its wing tips were "clipped" shortening its span by 4 feet 3 inches. First introduced on the Mark V Spitfire, the purpose of the clipped wing was to give the Spitfire an improved rate of role and better overall performance. This modification was frequently adapted to LF versions. Mark XVI Spitfires are all LF or "low flight" models, but were built in four configurations: a standard wing, high back fuselage; a clipped wing, high back fuselage; a standard wing, low back fuselage with a "bubble" canopy; and the clipped wing, low back "bubble" canopy represented here. The Mark IX was built with these variants along with others using different Merlin engine types. The Mk XVI was a very formidable opponent in aerial combat at lower altitudes. It was also often fitted with external, below-wing bomb racks and was employed in the ground attack role in the support of land forces. The Spitfire Mk XVI's performance and combat record was outstanding, as were most of the other Spitfire types. It remained in service with the Royal Air Force after World War II until relieved by jet aircraft. Several of the later variants of the Spitfire remained in service with the air forces of a number of nations for some years after the war.]]>

<![CDATA[Advances in aeronautical engineering exploded under the pressures of World War II. Both German and Allied engineers raced to develop jet-powered aircraft. The race was won by the Germans when they placed their Messerschmitt Me 262 into operation first. The British Gloster Meteor was only a few weeks behind and has the honor of being the only Allied jet-powered combat aircraft to reach operational status during World War II. The design of the Meteor actually began during the Battle of Britain in 1940. The intrinsic problems of creating such a revolutionary new machine were profound and it was not until March 5, 1943, that the first machine took to the air. The first delivery of production Meteors was to No. 616 Squadron on July 27, 1944. Given their speed, one of their first missions was to shoot down incoming German V-1 "Buzz Bombs" [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The second variant of the Meteor was the Mk III [modeled here]. It had engines with greater thrust and it had a greater fuel capacity. Meteor IIIs of No. 616 Squadron were sent to Belgium in January of 1945 and were the first Allied jet aircraft to be deployed to the European Continent.]]>

<![CDATA[The Fiat engineer Giuseppi Gabrielli designed the Fiat G.50, which first flew on February 26, 1937. It was the first Regia Aeronautica all-metal monoplane fighter. It also had retractable landing gear. A dozen aircraft from the first production lot were sent to Spain for combat trials flying for the Nationalist forces. The fighter performed well and was put into full production. When Italy entered World War II on the side of Germany in June of 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had 118 G.50s in service. As Germany's new ally, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini wanted to show his support in the war against England and dispatched 48 G.50s to Belgium to assist the Luftwaffe in its campaign against the British Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. However, the main use of the G.50 was during the Italian invasion of Greece, the Balkans, and in the Italian campaign in North Africa. The G.50s did well until Hawker Hurricanes were put in service in the North African conflict. Slower and with weak armament, the G.50s were no match for the RAF fighters. By the time of the Italian armistice in September 1943, almost all G.50s had been withdrawn from front line service.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was one of the truly classic fighters of World War II. Its distinctive "inverted gull wing" was designed to allow clearance for its huge 13-foot-diameter propeller. In order to keep its landing gear to a reasonable length, they were positioned at the depression in the wings. The Corsair was designed by Rex B. Beisel, Vought's chief engineer, in response to a 1938 United States Navy request for a new high-performance aircraft carrier fighter. The machine was literally built around the new Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp 2,000 hp radial engine, the most powerful of its type at the time. This required a very long forward fuselage, which impaired the pilots forward vision when landing, especially on the deck of an aircraft carrier. While early flight trials proved the aircraft had superb performance, the Navy deemed that due to its forward visibility restrictions it was not suitable for carrier operations. The Corsair was, therefore, first deployed in the ground attack and fighter roles from land bases usually flown by United States Marine Corps pilots. Numbers of these fighters were sent to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program. The British pilots learned to land the Corsair on their carriers, which were smaller than their American counterparts. They successfully did so by approaching the carrier at a wing down angle allowing for adequate viewing of its deck then straightening flight in the final seconds before touch down. This system was taught to American Navy pilots and the Corsair subsequently became a very effective U.S. carrier fighter. The overall effectiveness of the Corsair can be best judged by the fact that during World War II it flew no fewer than 64,051 sorties destroying 2,140 enemy aircraft for a loss of just 189 of its own—an astounding 11:1 kill ratio. The Corsair was just as effective a ground attack machine as it was a fighter. Production of this gull winged fighter continued until 1952 with a total over 12,500 being built.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was a first in many ways for the British Fleet Air Arm—it was the first dive bomber, first monoplane, first deck-landing aircraft to have flaps, first to have retractable landing gear, and the first to have a variable pitch propeller. Designed with almost irreconcilable requirements—fighter and dive bomber—the machine first flew on February 9, 1937 and, after several modifications, deliveries to operational units of the Fleet Air Arm began in October of 1938. Another first for the Skua is that it was the first British aircraft to shoot down a German aircraft, a Dornier D0-18, in WW II. Still, by the time World War II broke out, Skuas were obsolete as a fighters but they continued in operation as dive bombers. In that role, Skuas of No. 800 Squadron and No. 803 Squadron sank the German cruiser Konigsberg in the harbor of Bergen, Norway on April 10, 1940. These aircraft also covered the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940. Lacking the performance needed in the fighter role, Skuas were withdrawn from operational service in 1941 and were replaced by Fairey Fulmars [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Some remaining Skuas carried on a while longer as target tugs and as trainers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Roc was derived from the Blackburn Skua [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was the first Fleet Air Arm aircraft to have a powered turret. The concept for this fighter began in 1937 with the belief that a two-seat fighter had potential. The pilot could concentrate on flying and the rear gunner could sight and fire the four machine guns in the rear turret. This meant that unlike conventional fighters, side attacks on enemy bombers from the movable rear turret would be possible. However, the concept failed—the weight of the extra crew member along with the weight of the powered turret and larger fuselage needed to accommodate the turret made the aircraft heavy and slow, making it difficult for the fighter to catch or even keep up with most contemporary bombers of the time. When the machine's short-comings were realized after entering service in February of 1940, efforts were made to improve its performance, including the enlargement of its propeller, but the aircraft never became competitive enough to function in its intended role as a fighter. The Roc's maximum speed and ceiling were lower than the Roc's predecessor, the Blackburn Skua. While Blackburn was responsible for the design , the aircraft were produced by Boulton Paul, the firm that designed and manufactured the electrically-controlled turret. Production ended after a short run of 136 aircraft. Nonetheless, these machines, for all their defects, labored on until all were withdrawn from service in September of 1944.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Hawker Tempest was a direct descendent of the Hawker Typhoon [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The performance of the Typhoon left something to be desired when engaged in air combat. In efforts to improve the Typhoon's rate of climb and performance at higher altitudes, the new Tempest was designed with a new, thinner wing and lengthened fuselage. A dominant feature of the Tempest was its large chin radiator, which was retained from the Typhoon design. The Tempest first flew in September of 1942. It required numerous modifications to its airframe and power plant, which delayed the entry of the Tempest Mk V into service until April 1944, when the machines were assigned to the above RAF unit. A significant part of their work was the interception and destruction of incoming German V-1 "Buzz Bombs" targeted at London. The success of the Tempests of No. 3 Squadron can be measured by the fact that of 1,847 V-1s destroyed in the air between June 1944 and March of 1945, 258 were shot down by No. 3 Squadron using Tempest aircraft. Following the Allied invasion of Europe in June 1944, Tempest fighters assumed a ground attack role in support of the troops advancing across France and Belgium. Hawker Tempests continued to operate as fighters and it is reported that 20 of the new German Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] were shot down by Tempests [usually when taking off or landing from their airfields which was the only time a propeller fighter could catch and destroy an Me 262].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Hawker Typhoon was designed as a replacement for the famous Hawker Hurricane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Its design began in 1937 around the new Napier Sabre engine, but modifications in the machine's new airframe and power plant delayed its appearance with operational units of the Royal Air Force until September 1941. During the early weeks of the Typhoon's operation, numerous accidents were caused by a weakness in the machines rear fuselage, which required its withdrawal from high-altitude interception combat duties and its confinement to low level flight patterns. It was in the ground attack role that the big Typhoon proved itself to be well suited. Carrying up to 2,000 pounds of bombs under its wings and with its four 20-mm cannon, its support of the advancing Allied ground forces across Europe was outstanding. The Typhoon became one of the best ground support aircraft of the war. In the air-to-air fighter role the Typhoon's successor, the Hawker Tempest [modeled elsewhere in this collection], emerged as the superior machine.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This small biplane was in about the middle of the long linage of fighter aircraft designed by Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov, who was a Soviet aeronautical engineer who designed his first aircraft while incarcerated in a Stalin-controlled Soviet political prison. The success of his early designs achieved his freedom in time to develop the Polikarpov I-15 bis [modeled here]. Following in the wake of previous Polikarpov fighters, the I-15 bis first flew in October of 1933. It had a welded steel frame with a mixed metal and fabric covering. Unlike the I-15 [its immediate predecessor which had a gull wing] the "bis" variant had a straight upper wing; it retained the solitary "I" type inter-wing strut and fixed under carriage, but with wheel covers. The new fighter had excellent maneuverability and handling and was put into immediate production. Some 155 of the I-15 fighters saw combat while flying for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Their performance in the Spanish War was excellent, but the I-15s were obsolete when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941. Yet, they remained in service during the early months of the war. They faired very poorly against the modern Messerschmitt Me Bf 109 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Their only hope of survival was to use their agility and maneuver away from the superior German fighters. As the war on the eastern front progressed, the I-15s were gradually replaced by more modern machines and relegated to training duties.]]>

<![CDATA[Martlet was the name given by the British to the United States Grumman F4F Wildcat naval fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The F4F was a mid-wing monoplane which first flew on September 2, 1937. It entered service with the United States Navy as its principle carrier fighter in 1940. Great Britain and France were then at war and, needing modern carrier-based fighters, both countries placed orders for the new F4F. Before their delivery was possible, France capitulated to Germany and the French order was taken over by Britain. The first Martlets reached Great Britain in August of 1940 and were attached to Fleet Air Arm No. 804 Squadron at Hatston, replacing Gloster Sea Gladiators [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Martlets saw extensive service not only on the Royal Navy larger fleet carriers, but also on their smaller escort carriers, which were providing air cover for convoys all over the Atlantic and Artic Oceans. Passage of the Lend-Lease Act allowed Great Britain to obtain many more Martlets, which equipped 16 different Fleet Air Arm Squadrons before the end of the war. These Martlet squadrons made a major contribution in combating German submarines and in winning of the Battle of the Atlantic.]]>

<![CDATA[The Avia was one in the series of fighter aircraft developed by the Czech firm Avia. The B.35 was a successor to previous machines such as the Avia B.534 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The B.35 was a low-wing monoplane of metal construction in the forward fuselage and of plywood skin bound to aluminum tubing aft. The wings were of wooden spars covered by plywood bound to aluminum sheet. Initially, it had been planned to equip the machine with retractable landing gear, but difficulties with design ended with the B.35 having a fixed cantilevered undercarriage with covered wheels. Test trials began in September of 1938 and resulted in several changes and improvements in both the B.35's power plant and airframe. The B.35 was the first Czech aircraft to have flaps. At the time of its development, it was a modern machine with excellent handling properties and reasonable fire power. Work on the B.35 was impacted by the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939, and progress in its evolution and production gradually came to a stop. The aircraft had no true impact on World War II, but it was a fighter that was a part of the Czech Air Force during the conflict.]]>

<![CDATA[Built as a private venture by the Bristol Company in 1931, the Bulldog III was the immediate predecessor of the Mk IV modeled here. The MK IV, although an improvement over the III, still retained the overall features of a World War I fighter—biplane, fabric covered, open cockpit and with only two rifle-caliber machine guns. Aside from more powerful engines and greater speed, there was little difference between the Bulldog IV and WWI machines. First flying in the Spring of 1934, the Bristol Mk IV had a brief career with the Royal Air Force until replaced by the Gloster Gladiator, a more modern biplane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Finland, devoid of its own military aircraft production capability, purchased 17 Bulldog Mk IVs in April of 1934. They remained in front line service with the Finnish Air Force up to and into the first years of World War II while Finland was fighting the Soviet Union. By all standards, these fighters were totally obsolete, yet, they were flown by brave Finnish pilots who had no better machines with which to combat their enemy. A few of these machines served as trainers but the majority were assigned to fighter combat units.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was one of the smallest and lightest operational fighters of World War II. It weighed about a third of that of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the heaviest fighter of the war. The Caudron C.714 was a direct descendent of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe racing monoplanes. It first flew in the fall of 1938 and after flight trials the French government placed an order for 100 machines to serve with the Armée de l'Air. However, after the production of only 90 aircraft, manufacture at its Point-du-Jour plant was terminated because the machine was found to have very poor climbing abilities and became regarded as too weak. Some 50 of the production run were diverted from the Armée de l'Air and were sold to Finland, but only 8 of these arrived in operable condition, the others were never shipped or were damaged beyond repair while in transit. Those C.714s, which remained and flew in France, were all assigned to a single fighter unit—the GC 1/145, a group of Polish fighter pilots who had fled Poland and immigrated to France after the fall of their country. Records are not totally clear, but apparently the unit achieved 12 official kills during the Battle of France before the Poles had to once again immigrate—this time to England following the fall of France.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In the final months of the Third Reich, Germany was being destroyed by Allied bombing. In a desperate effort to counter these raids, the German High Command pushed forward a plan for a new inexpensive jet fighter made of non-essential materials—the Heinkel He 162 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. To avoid the destruction of Allied bombing, the plants to manufacture these jets were placed under ground in old salt mines. Within just 3 months, Heinkel designed and flew the first He 162. The new small jet fighter was powered by a BMW 003E-1 turbojet engine. This was the same power plant that powered the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter and the BMW engines were in very short supply, seriously slowing the production of the new He 162 fighter. To address this problem, Heinkel engineers attempted to substitute the more available Argus 109 014 pulse jet engines in the He 162 airframe. The pulse jet engines were the same engines used in the Fieselier 103 "Buzz Bomb" [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The marriage of the He 162 airframe and the Argus engine proved problematic due to the inadequate thrust provided by the Argus pulse jet engine. Trials and modifications to achieve this union were underway when the war ended. None of the pulse jet-powered He 162s were ever operational with the Luftwaffe.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The design of this aircraft began in the summer of 1940 by Roberto Longhi and Antonio Alessio, the same team that designed the Reggiano Re.2001. The Daimler Benz liquid-cooled inline power plants, which had powered the Re.2001, were in very short supply so the two designers decided to replace them with the radial engine Paggio P.XIX RC 45. This reverted back to the radial engine format of the original Re.2000, from which the entire line of Reggiane fighters had first evolved. The first Re.2002 prototype flew in October of 1940 and immediately proved to be a very fine machine with great performance. But problems obtaining power plants again delayed its production, which did not begin until March of 1942. The first Re.2002s began equipping fighter units of the Regia Aeronautica in March of 1943, just six months before the Italian capitulation to the Allies in September of 1943. Following the Italian Armistice, many of these fighters flew with the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force with the Allies. However, at least 60 Re.2002s, which had been located in northern Italy in an area controlled by the Germans at the time of the armistice, were seized by them. They were given German insignia and placed in service with the Luftwaffe. Thus, the same aircraft from the same manufacturer and formerly in the same air force were fighting each other on opposite sides in the war. Throughout its career, the Re.2001 found its greatest use as a ground attack and close support aircraft supporting armies in the field.]]>

<![CDATA[When Japan entered World War II against Great Britain and the Commonwealth Nations, Australia found itself without fighter aircraft protection. The threat of a Japanese invasion was serious. The Australian government turned to its Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in this emergency and requested they design and build a new fighter. In just 16 weeks and 3 days the Boomerang went from its first paper plans to successful flight. It essentially employed a license-built North American NA-33 trainer airframe and an American Pratt & Whitney twin wasp radial engine. No true prototype was ever built. Given the urgency of the time the machine went straight into production and the first production aircraft flew on May 29, 1942. The machine was rather heavily armed for a small fighter [4 machine guns and 2 cannon]. Its service was confined to the Pacific theater against the Japanese, where its performance was good although it did not match up to the newer United States fighters which emerged later in the war. The CA-13 was an emergency aircraft quickly built to meet an urgent need—it did its job rather well.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[It is ironic that at a time when the Soviet Air Force was still demanding that biplane fighters like the Polikarpov I-15, the I-152 and the I-153 [all modeled elsewhere in this collection] continue to be designed and manufactured, Polikarpov had also designed and built one of the world's first monoplane fighters with a retractable landing gear. The aviation world was deeply impressed and shocked when the little I-16 fighter first flew in 1933, for it was well ahead of its time. It is equally ironic that its designer, Nikolai N. Polikarpov, was compelled to do much of his design work while in a Stalin-controlled political prison. He was eventually released due to his excellent work. The first production I-16s were supplied to the Soviet Air Force in late 1934. Their performance was outstanding, but only became appreciated by the Western nations when these fighters began shooting down their Nationalist enemies [flying modern German and Italian aircraft] during the Spanish Civil War. They came to be nicknamed "Rata" ["Rat"] because of their small size and agility. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the I-16 was the fighter in the largest numbers with the Soviet Air Force. They were active over the entire Soviet front until replaced by more modern fighters later in the war. The career of the I-16 was not limited to the Soviet front—some 200 I-16s were deployed by the Chinese Air Force in their conflict with Japan. During the I-16's entire production run an astounding 20,000 of all its variants were produced—among the largest number of any World War II fighter.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was unique, for it was the only Japanese fighter that was built with an inline liquid-cooled engine. All other Japanese fighters of World War II had radial engines. The manufacture of the Ki-61 using an inline engine was possible because the engineers at Kawasaki acquired the rights from Germany to build the Daimler Benz DB 601A liquid-cooled power plant for their new fighter. The new fighter program began in 1941 under the direction of Takeo Doi, the design engineer of several other World War II Japanese military aircraft. The first Ki-61 [Allied code-named "Tony"] took to the air in December of 1941, shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Its overall elegant appearance was very similar to the Italian Macchi MC 202 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was a superior fighter and its performance was better than any comparable Allied machine when it began equipping combat units in February of 1943. The Ki-61 was an excellent fighter, perhaps Japan's best when it was functioning properly—its engine was subject to frequent breakdowns and it was difficult to maintain and repair. A total of over 2,700 Ki-61s of all of variants were manufactured during World War II.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Designed by the Italian aeronautical engineer Mario Castoldi, this aircraft was the ancestor of an entire family of World War II Italian fighters. The M.C.200 was built in response to a specification from the Regia Aeronautica for a new monoplane fighter issued in 1935. The machine first flew December 24, 1937. Production deliveries began in July, 1939, just two months before the outbreak of World War II and continued until July of 1942, when it was replaced in production by more modern Macchi fighters. A total of 1,151 of all variants were manufactured. The M.C.200 proved to be strong and maneuverable, but slow compared to other contemporary fighters of the era. Another shortcoming was its light armament of only two 12.7 mm machine guns—meager compared to that of other fighters, both German and Allied. When Italy entered World War II in the summer of 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had 144 M.C.200s in service with its fighter units. They served on all fronts in which the Italian military were involved, but did not see action in the area of the English Channel or Northern Europe. In the North African and Balkan theaters, some were fitted with under-wing bomb racks and wing-mounted 7.7 mm machine guns and performed as ground attack aircraft. At the time of the Italian armistice in September of 1943, 52 were still in service with the Regia Aeronautica and subsequently flew with the Cobelligerent Air Force alongside Allied aircraft. Eight were reported to have been taken over by the Northern Italian regime that remained under German control.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the French fighter which was available in the greatest numbers to the Armée de l'Air when World War II broke out in September of 1939. Specifications for the aircraft were issued in 1935 by the Armée de l'Air. The design and development of the M.S.406 were carried out with some secrecy until the announcement of the aircraft's existence was made at the Brussels Air Show of 1937, when its manufacturers stated that it was "the best fighter in the world." Events proved them wrong. After successful flight trials of its prototype, production models began equipping fighter escadrilles in December of 1938. By the beginning of World War II in September the following year, the Armée de l'Air had 572 M.S.406s in service. But from the beginning of their operations in the war it was obvious that they were no match for their main enemy the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The M.S.406 had neither the speed to over take the Bf 109 nor the agility to match the German fighter. A reported 150 M.S.406s were lost during the Battle of France, others were destroyed on the ground. Production continued at an accelerated pace at the onset of the war so despite their losses. At the time of the French capitulation to Germany in June of 1940, some 400 M.S.406 were transferred to the Vichy French Air Force where they continued to serve largely in the French colonies in North Africa and the Middle East. Some of the M.S.406s that had remained in France after the German occupation were handed over to Finland. Overall, the M.S.406 was, at best, a mediocre fighter. It was certainly not on a par with its peers of the time.]]>

Additional orders for the Armée de l'Air were placed after the first production machines began being delivered in France.

<![CDATA[This aircraft was a successor to the LaGG-3 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Although manufactured in large numbers [over 6,000 were produced], the LaGG-3 was mediocre at best and essentially failed in its intended role as a fighter. Semyon Alekseyevich Lavochkin, the designer of the entire line of fighters bearing his name, sought to improve the LaGG-3 whose main problem was an inadequate power plant. He replaced the LaGG-3 engine with a more powerful engine and created one of the better Soviet fighters of World War II. Tests on the new machine began in March of 1942 and it was immediately evident that the new La-5 was a very superior machine with great performance. The fuselage of the older LaGG-3 was altered to allow for a bubble-like canopy that allowed for 360° visibility. Whereas the LaGG-3 was made entirely of wood, the La-5 had metal spars and some metal coverings. The La-5 was placed into immediate production and began equipping combat units along the entire Soviet front. The La-5 proved to be a great machine. Its only fault was difficult handling in takeoff and landing. Including all variants, almost 10,000 La-5s were manufactured during World War II.]]>

<![CDATA[This biplane flying boat was designed and built by the Supermarine Company in response to a 1931 British Air Ministry specification for a new naval reconnaissance aircraft. In is design the Supermarine Company borrowed much from their previous Southampton and Scapa flying boats. The resultant machine, named Stranraer, had an all-metal hull, fabric-covered wings, and extensive inter-wing struts and bracing wires. It had an open gun position in the rear fuselage. The first Stranraer entered service with Coastal Command in 1936. Numbers of these machines remained with operational units throughout the 1930s and well into World War II, engaged in the role of naval reconnaissance and air-sea rescue. The Stranraer was also built under license in Canada and these machines equipped the Royal Canadian Air Force performing in much the same role, that of naval reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrol flying out of Nova Scotia. The Stranraers remained in active service with both British and Canadian units until they were gradually replaced by Consolidated PBY Catalina's [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The final Stranraer was withdrawn for service in April of 1944.]]>

<![CDATA[This fighter was the product of the two Soviet aeronautical engineers Artem Ivanovich Mikoyan and Mikhail Iossipovich Gurevich. The Designator "MiG" is derived from their names and has been associated with a very long line of warplanes produced in the Soviet Union for over a half century. The MiG-3 [modeled here] project began in 1938. The fighter was designed around the new Mikulin 1,200 hp engine, with smallest possible airframe to house this large power plant. The machine was of mixed construction using both metal and wood. It was a low-wing monoplane with fully retractable landing gear. The MiG-3's maiden flight was on April 9, 1940. After only minor modifications, the new fighter was put into mass production despite its faults of poor maneuverability, limited range, inadequate armament and lack of protection. The MiG-3 proved to be at its best when flying in combat at altitudes of over 16,000 feet, its performance suffered at lower altitudes. The greatest shortcoming of the MiG-3 was its weak armament of only three machine guns. The MiG-3 must be considered a transition aircraft employed by the Soviet Air Force until more modern fighters were available. A total of 3,322 were built before their production ceased in favor of the production of those better, more modern fighters.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Gladiator was the Royal Air Force's last biplane fighter. The machine was originally built by Gloster in response to an Air Ministry specification issued in 1930 for a new fighter with a speed of 240 mph and with 4 machine guns. The first Gladiator flew in September of 1934 and the aircraft showed immediately that it had excellent performance. Production was ordered and Gladiators began equipping Royal Air Force fighter squadrons in February 1937. When World War II broke out, thirteen RAF fighter squadrons were flying the Gladiator. Of these, No. 607 and No. 615 squadrons were sent to France in support of British Expeditionary Forces. Their combat experiences there clearly proved that they were no match for the more modern German fighters. Thus, Gladiator squadrons were transferred to the Mediterranean theater and to the Middle East were they faced Italian fighters of much less quality. One of the Gladiator's finest moments came in the defense of the beleaguered island of Malta which, in 1940, was under almost daily attack from Italian and German bombers. Three Gloster Sea Gladiators [a variant of the Gloster Gladiator] were virtually the only remaining British fighter aircraft left on the island. They performed brilliantly and were named "Faith," "Hope," and "Charity" by a local journalist in his romanticized account of their actions. Of that trio, it is "Faith" that is modeled here. As the war progressed, Gladiators were removed from front line combat squadrons and were relegated to training units or were employed as reconnaissance, communication, and meteorological aircraft. A surviving World War II Gloster Gladiator is on permanent display in the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon, England.]]>

Production of the P-40E totaled 2,320 for the United States Army Air Force including 1,500 for the British Royal Air Force provided under Lend-Lease. The P-40E also equipped fighter Squadrons from New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, China, and Canada. The total production of P-40s in all of their variants was 13,728. Even after the performance of the P-40 had been eclipsed by more modern fighters, its production continued until November 1944. Many of the P-40s employed in the North African campaign [such as the prototype of this model] were used as fighter bombers and ground-attack aircraft rather than as air-to-air combat fighters.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Engineers at Bell Aviation at their plant in Buffalo, New York, had great expectations for their revolutionary new aircraft—it looked good on paper. It was truly new and different and was the first fighter in the world to have a "tricycle" landing gear, which gave the pilot excellent visibility during take off, landing, and taxiing and reduced the risk of nosing over—a significant problem with high performance aircraft with powerful engines and large diameter propellers. In addition, its engine was mounted at the machine's center of gravity, above the wing and behind the pilot. Power to the propeller was transmitted by a 9-foot long shaft beneath and between the pilots legs. This radical change from other aircraft of the time was planned to impart to the P-39 better maneuverability since the heavy engine was located at the center of the airplane instead of being swung around at its extremity. Another unusual feature of the P-39 was its 37 mm cannon, which fired through the propeller hub. No other fighter of the time had such a heavy and devastating weapon. Automobile type doors on each side of the fuselage provided access to the cockpit. The first flight of this totally different machine occurred on April 6, 1938. However, it turned out to be a case of unfulfilled expectations because the projected performance of its designers was never achieved. Although the aircraft was employed by the United States on several fronts, it was never highly regarded by U.S. pilots. The machine had multiple defects—including carbon monoxide build up in the cockpit, compass errors after firing the cannon, and the need for very long takeoff runs when loaded. An order for over 200 of the new P-39s by the British Royal Air Force was cancelled after early machines proved to be inadequate against German fighters. Aircraft from the cancelled British order along with hundreds of other P-39s were subsequently sent to the Soviet Union, where they had a better performance record. The modest to poor performance of the aircraft in U.S. and British hands did not, however, slow its production. A total of over 9,500 P-39s of all models were built during the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built for the Japanese Imperial Army. It entered service and had a career of initial outstanding successes and later failures, similar to that of the Japanese Imperial Navy's famous Mitsubishi A6M Zero [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Nakajima Ki-43 [Allied code-named "Oscar"] project began in December of 1937 when the Army issued a specification for a new fighter to replace the Nakajima Ki-27 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Nakajima design team was led by Hideo Itokawa and development took one year with the first prototype taking to the air in January of 1939. The machine's initial trails revealed inadequate maneuverability. Later installation of "combat" wing flaps allowed for extremely tight turns. With these improvements, the Ki-43 went into mass production with the first Ki-43s equipping combat fighter units in June of 1941—just in time for Japan's march across the Pacific. The Ki-43 I [modeled here] had combat deficiencies. After the production of 716 aircraft a new variant, the Ki-43 II, was begun. It differed form the older Ki-43 by having a more powerful engine and a three-bladed propeller instead of the two-blade propeller of the Ki-43 I machines. Over the ensuing months, a total of 10 different variants of the Ki-43 were built. The late variants were more competitive with the new Allied high-performance fighters that were entering the Pacific theater. Still, they never matched the performance of the better American fighters. Including all of its variants, 5,870 Ki-43s were built. Like its Mitsubishi A6M Zero stable mate, it was a much feared and effective fighter in the early years of its career, but was eclipsed by its Allied opponents in later years.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Dornier Do 335 was one of the most unusual appearing aircraft of World War II. Dornier engineers were not hampered by tradition as they designed the machine. They had been interested in the concept of centerline thrust, where two engines shared the same thrust line—one pulling and the other pushing. The aerodynamic advantages of such an arrangement seemed promising. A single prototype aircraft employing this scheme was built and, in 1940, testing confirmed the value of the concept. However, the German Air Ministry decreed that Dornier abandon this project and concentrate on its traditional responsibility of producing bombers and flying boats for the Luftwaffe. In 1942, German officials issued a specification for a new high performance fighter to counter the waves of Allied bombers that were severely damaging German industry with their raids. Dornier responded by revisiting their previous plans for a push-pull aircraft. The resulting machine was fearsome in appearance with a long slender fuselage, fore and aft propellers, and a tricycle landing gear prompting German airman to nickname it Ameisenbär ["ant eater"]. Its initial trials in the Autumn of 1943 revealed the machine to have excellent flight properties, but given the advanced and unusual character of the new aircraft, it had multiple problems that required time to correct. Generally speaking, its speed, acceleration, and handling were outstanding. Three variants were built: a single seat fighter, a night fighter with a pilot and a second crewman to operate the radar and weapons systems, and a training two-seat version. All three were in aggressive evaluation as the war was coming to an end. The night fighter variant [modeled here] was painted black and had flame dampeners on its exhausts. Only 37 Do 335s of all variants had been manufactured before the end of the war and none of them were ever engaged in combat with Allied aircraft. Only one A-6 night fighter prototype was built. The performance data is for the single seat fighter version.]]>

The machine was intended to be a high-performance, high-altitude night fighter/interceptor to combat the nightly bombing of German cities by British bombers. Its night operation required it to have flame suppressors on all of its exhausts and that it be painted in a flat black color—thus making the machine less visible to Allied fighters and gunners. The first prototype flew on September of 1944. It was a very advanced machine with a pressurized cabin suited for its high altitude role and it was to carry an array of heavy armament. Only two prototypes were completed and neither reached combat units before the end of the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Although America was neutral at the time, its military leaders recognized with deep concern the terrible pounding the German Luftwaffe was giving London and other English cities by night. It also noted the almost total lack of ability of the Royal Air Force's primitive night fighters to stop these raids. An ambitious program was undertaken to build a radar-controlled night fighter. In January of 1941, when the United States was supposed to be neutral, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working secretly with British scientists using the cavity magnetron designed and successfully tested a centimeter-wavelength radar device [subsequently called Al], which could be used aboard an aircraft. With the issue of the night-time location of enemy bombers resolved, attention was turned to the airframe to carry the new revolutionary equipment. Northrop set about to design and build the first night fighter in the world to be created from paper to flight as a dedicated night fighter [previous night fighters had all been modifications of previously existing airframes]. The first P-61 Black Widow flew on May 21, 1942. The airframe was as revolutionary as its radar with two engines on twin booms. The machine was an immediate success, yet its complexities required hundreds of revisions and modifications to airframe, radar, engines and offensive armament. The first operational kill by a P-61 was in the Pacific theater on July 7, 1944. By the time the P-61 became operational in mid 1944 the night skies were almost devoid of German bombers, with the same being true of Japanese bombers in the Pacific so the pickings were slim for the new Black Widow when performing in the role for which it was intended. Nevertheless, the P-61s were now rolling off the assembly lines at about three a day—something had to be done with them. Most were modified as "intruders" attacking ground targets at night. The P-61 was a very successful aircraft once the complicated technology it embraced was worked out. That it made its greatest contribution as a night ground attack platform and not a true aircraft night fighter, is a footnote in history.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine has been regarded by many aviation historians as one the best night fighters of World War II. It possessed the three major attributes required in such an aircraft: effective radar, heavy fire power, and excellent speed. Despite having all three attributes, the Luftwaffe, for some unexplainable reason, never took much interest in the He 219. To make matters worse, the plant in Rostock, Germany, which manufactured the aircraft was bombed in March and April of 1942 by the British Royal Air Force and over three quarters of the He 219 plant was destroyed. Designed as a night fighter, the Heinkel engineers pressed on and, almost without Luftwaffe approval, the He 219 was built and made its first flight on November 15, 1942. Its performance was good and with some subsequent modifications it became excellent. The new FuG 220 SN-2 Lichtenstein radar was fitted into the machine and limited production began with the first machines going to the night fighter unit at Venlo, Netherlands. The worth of the He 219 was proven on its first combat mission on the night of June 11/12, 1943, when an He 219 in the space of 30 minutes shot down 5 British Lancaster bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Over the next six days, He 219s shot down no fewer than 20 more night-raiding British bombers, including six de Havilland Mosquitoes [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which had always been consider too fast to ever shoot down. Despite its success, the He 219 was ignored and less than 300 were produced. Later in the war, when British night bombing was devastating German industry, the Luftwaffe developed a belated interest in producing the He 219 but by this time material, plant facilities, and time had run out.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Developed as a private venture, the Bristol Company used available components from the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber [wings, rear fuselage, tail structure, and landing gear] for their new machine, the Beaufighter. This composite of parts created one of the most successful aircraft of World War II. With the increasing destruction being rained upon England by the German night bombing raids of London and other English cities, the Royal Air Force badly needed a high performance night fighter. The Beaufighter was thus adapted and fitted with the new Al Mk IV radar. The first such equipped machine entered service with Fighter Command in August of 1940, flying their first operational sorties in September of that year. The Beaufighter performed extremely well in the role of night fighter destroying many German bombers. The daytime versions were equally effective in combat in the Mediterranean theater, where their were used as torpedo bombers against enemy shipping and as ground attack aircraft against tanks and other targets. These heavily armed machines were among the very best machines of their type in World War II.]]>

<![CDATA[Two coordinated events marked the beginning of the end for Japan in World War II. The first was the appearance of the American B 29 heavy bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The second was the successful invasion and occupation of numbers of western Pacific islands from which the B 29 could fly and attack Japanese cities and industry. Bombing largely at night, the B 29 was gradually destroying Japanese industry and Japan's ability to wage war. Recognizing the Mitsubishi Ki-46's assets of great speed and performance at high altitude, numbers of the Ki-46 III aircraft [Allied code-named "Dinah"] underwent conversions into a night fighter variant--the Ki-46 III KAI [modeled here]. A 37 mm cannon firing upward at a 30° angle was fitted into their dorsal mid fuselage. The concept for these night fighters was to fly beneath the B 29s firing up into their formations. World War II records are unclear just how effective this strategy proved to be. Nonetheless, the Ki-46 III KAI remained in active service in the night fighter role until the last nights of the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[During World War I, fighters had evolved with two fixed forward-firing machine guns. This configuration persisted in fighter design into the 1930s. A new concept immerged with British aircraft planners—a two-seat fighter. The pilot could fly the machine relieved of aiming or firing guns and a gunner relieved of flying the airplane could aim and fire the machine's weapons. Responding to an Air Ministry specification for such a machine, the Boulton Paul Aircraft Company designed and built a machine named the "Defiant." Its maiden flight was on August 11, 1937. It was an all-metal low wing monoplane with a powered four-gun turret behind the pilot manned by a gunner. It was initially thought to have great potential. The first production aircraft began supplying Royal Air Force fighter units in December of 1940. German fighters, making conventional attacks on the rear of the new Defiants confusing them for Hawker Hurricanes [modeled elsewhere in this collection], were met with an unexpected hail of bullets from four machine guns. In their first month of deployment, Defiants shot down 65 German aircraft. But it did not take long for the German pilots to learn that they could attack the Defiant head-on or from the belly with complete immunity. With the same power plant as the Hawker Hurricane but slowed by the added weight of the turret, its equipment, and its gunner, the Defiant was out-classed and became easy prey for Luftwaffe fighters. The losses were so terrible that Defiants were withdrawn from daylight operations and were deployed exclusively as night fighters with 13 RAF squadrons. Some Defiants were used as target tugs and as Army cooperation aircraft. Overall, the machine has to be considered only moderately successful if not, in fact, an outright failure.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Bristol Aircraft Company, lead by its chief engineer Frank Barnwell, designed and built this machine in a private venture as a six-passenger fast transport. It first flew in 1933. One of the first aircrafts produced was purchased by Lord Rothemere, owner and publisher of the Daily Mail, for his personal use. This introduced the concept of the corporate aircraft. Lord Rothemere's new transport, named Britain First, was 30 mph faster than any of the Royal Air Force's current fighters. As an air power advocate, Lord Rothemere pressured the Royal Air Force into developing an interest in the new Bristol aircraft as a light bomber. In the summer of 1935, the Air Ministry placed an order for 130 of the Bristol aircraft for this role. They required modifications including glazing of the nose to accommodate a bomb aimer, a bomb bay, and a dorsal turret. Initial deliveries to RAF squadrons began in March of 1937. One hundred sixty eight Blenheim Mk Is were in active RAF service when World War II began. The first operative mission of the Royal Air Force in World War II was a reconnaissance flight of Blenheims over Germany on September 3, 1939, just 2 days after the beginning of the war. By the beginning of the war most Blenheim Mk Is had been removed from front line service. Over 200 were converted to night fighters employing the new Al Mk I radars. It is one of these that this model replicates. A total of 5,500 Blenheims of all versions were manufactured from 1937 until production ended in 1943. Blenheims saw service in most all theaters of the war: Europe, Mediterranean and the far East. Blenheims were eventually replaced by their successors, the Beauforts and the Beaufighters, but the machine marked the beginning of the fast all-metal attack bomber, despite the fact its origin was from a civilian aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In response to an Air Ministry specification in 1935 for a torpedo bomber and a general reconnaissance bomber, the Bristol Company decided to respond with a modification of their existing Bristol Blenheim. The Beaufort's fuselage was enlarged to accommodate torpedo carriage and to allow side by side seating of pilot and navigator. The high roof line of the revised fuselage, unbroken back to the rear turret, became a distinctive feature of the Beaufort. The original contract for the Beaufort was placed in August of 1936, but the first machine did not fly until October 15, 1938. Developmental problems caused delays and the aircraft did not enter service with No. 22 Squadron of Coastal Command, the first unit to receive the new machine, until January of 1940. The Beaufort's first operational mission was the planting of marine mines in German coastal waters in April of the same year. Engine problems plagued the early Beauforts, requiring brief stand-downs until adjustments could be made. The machines resumed action once these problems were resolved. The Australians manufactured the machine under license, but substituted American Pratt & Whitney engines in place of the British Bristol Taurus power plants. Beaufighters were the standard torpedo bombers with Coastal Command between 1940 and 1943 taking part in maritime action against the German warships Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen. The Beaufort remained active through 1943 until replaced by the Beaufighter.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was built in response to a 1933 German Air Ministry specification for a new dive bomber. The machine first flew in 1935, but in early trials two of the prototypes lost their upper wings during dive tests resulting in fatal crashes. Strengthening of the wing resulted in excellent performance and the machine was ordered into production. The Hs 123s' first combat was with the Condor Legion flying for the Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Its performance was quite good and it was in this conflict that the Hs 123 found its real role—that of a ground troop support attack aircraft. Despite its excellent performance, the machine was gradually being replaced in the dive bombing and ground support roles by the Junkers 87 Stuka [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. By the time of the outbreak of World War II, the unit listed above was the only Luftwaffe group still flying the Hs 123. This unit was heavily involved in the Polish, French, and Soviet invasions, where its performance was so outstanding that the Luftwaffe gave thought to resuming production of the unique biplane. This proved impractical and the few remaining Hs 123s were gradually transferred to training units. Without production aircraft to maintain its ranks, attrition took its toll and the last of the Hs 123s were gone by mid 1944 largely due to lack of spare parts. The aircraft modeled was operating on the Soviet front and is painted in white winter camouflage.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was unique when it was first designed by Willy Messerschmitt in response to a 1934 German government specification for a long-range fighter that could also be used as a light bomber. The first three prototypes of the new Bf 110 flew on May 12, 1936, and immediately caught the attention of Hermann Göring, chief of the Luftwaffe, who nicknamed the new machine "Zerstörer" ["Destroyer"]. Production Bf 110s began equipping Luftwaffe units just in time for the Blitzkrieg invasions of Poland, the Low Countries, and France, where their performance fulfilled every expectation of Göring and the other leaders of the Luftwaffe. Things changed dramatically when Bf 110s began to be confronted with modern Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes [both modeled elsewhere in this collection] in the Battle of Britain. The Bf 110s were shot out of the sky in droves and, as supposed fighters, found themselves in the uncomfortable position of requiring single-seat Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] to escort and protect them in order to survive. The Bf 110s were withdrawn from the fighter role and throughout the remainder of the war they were utilized by the Luftwaffe as ground attack, night fighter, anti-shipping, and reconnaissance machines. In fact, at the beginning of 1944 when the British night bombing raids of Germany were beginning to destroy its industry, over 60 percent of Luftwaffe night fighters were modified Bf 110 variants. The Bf 110 D-1 modeled here was deployed in North Africa as a ground-support attack aircraft and is camouflaged in an overall sand color typical of German aircraft operating in that theater.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the only aircraft of World War II that was designed from its inception for use in an anti-tank role. The Germans learned during the Spanish Civil War that air power over the battlefield could be decisive. With this realization, the Luftwaffe issued a specification in 1938 for an aircraft that would be used exclusively in the role of supporting ground troops and in the destruction of tanks. The first Hs 129 flew in February of 1939, just seven months before the beginning of World War II. The Hs 129 was unique. It had a triangular fuselage cross section with 2,380 pounds of armor protecting the pilot, the fuel tanks, and the engines. This feature was designed to render it immune to all but the heaviest caliber ground fire. It had large caliber cannon in its nose for the sole purpose of destroying tanks. In their planning, little did the Luftwaffe leaders realize just how important and correct this concept would become in the great tank battles that were ahead. The Germans had the right concept but they had nothing like enough Hs 129s to turn the tide of battle in their favor on the Soviet or the Western fronts. The version of the Hs 129 modeled here was a variant that carried a 75 mm cannon under its nose. Although the weight of this huge weapon and its recoil, when fired, adversely impacted the performance of the machine, a single hit on even a tanks heaviest armor by the 75 mm shell would penetrate the tank and destroy it. During the winter months on the Soviet front, many German ground crews daubed over their aircraft's usual camouflage with white soluble paint giving it a temporary color change to match the snow covered ground over which it flew. The aircraft modeled had been so treated. The Hs 129 was an effective weapon. A total of 879 were produced including just 25 of the version modeled and that was just not enough.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was the United States Navy's first monoplane dive bomber. It was designed and built in response to a Navy specification issued in 1934 for a new aircraft carrier based dive bomber. Its first trials were in the summer of 1936. It proved to be substantially better than existing biplane machines. It was named "Vindicator" by the Navy and was of all-metal construction except for outer wings and control surfaces, which were fabric covered. It had folding wings [to facilitate storage aboard aircraft carriers] and an arresting tail hook, which were standard on carrier-based machines. The Vindicator entered service with the Navy in the late 1930s and saw action during the early months of World War II, including being deployed from the airfield on Midway Island during the epic battle that took place off the shores of that island in June of 1942. However, the Vindicator was slow and very vulnerable to Japanese fighter attack. By late 1942, almost all Vindicators had been replaced by Douglas Dauntless bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Numbers of Vindicators that had been sold to the French Navy prior to the beginning of World War II were seized by the Germans after the French capitulation in June of 1940. The Luftwaffe employed them as trainers but never in combat. The British Royal Navy also received SB2Us under the Lend-Lease program. They were also used in the training role, and received the nickname "Chesapeake."]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Curtiss designed and built this aircraft in response to a 1932 specification for a new aircraft carrier-based two-seat fighter capable of dive bombing. The machine was named the "Helldiver" by the Curtiss Company. Production to fill a United States Navy contract began in August of 1936. In keeping with the tradition of the time, the new machine was a biplane but it did have landing gear that retracted into wells in the fuselage side. First deliveries of the new Helldiver were made to Navy Squadron VS-5 on July 17, 1937. The SBC-4 [modeled here] was the last variant of the series and the most advanced—it came to equip several U.S. Navy units during the late 1930s. With the desperate war situation in Europe in early 1940, both England and France purchased SBCs. The British called them "Clevelands," the French retained the name "Helldiver." In May of 1940, the French aircraft carrier Béarn sailed to the United States and collected 50 of the SBCs with the intent of returning them to France for operation with the French Navy. During its trans-Atlantic return trip, the Béarn received word of France's capitulation to Germany and was diverted to the French colony of Martinique in the West Indies where it unloaded the SBCs still in their crates. These machines then spent the remainder of the war sitting in their crates on a dock in Martinique. By the time of the United States' entry into World War II the SBCs had been replaced by the Douglas SBD Dauntless and had been relegated to use as trainers or had been scraped.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the last of a line of Curtiss-built dive bombers to carry the name Helldiver. Its design was in response to a 1938 United States Navy specification for a new aircraft carrier dive bomber that could complement or replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Curtiss announced that their large dive bomber would be the most efficient in the world, could carry twice the bomb load, fly 100 mph faster and 600 miles further, remain in flight 4 hours longer, had twice the fire power of any existing type then in use, and Curtiss would build 1,000 of them. Although Curtiss had built only a single prototype at the time it made that statement, it received a government contract that would require the building of a huge new plant in Columbus, Ohio. Forgotten in all this rush was the fact that the prototype was riddled with defects, many of them serious. Nonetheless, production began and many alterations were required as Curtiss attempted to correct the new Helldiver's many faults. One of these was severe buffeting of the tail when the machine's dive brake wing flaps were extended. This vibration spoiled the aim of the dive. Corrective efforts increased the weight of the Helldiver and reduced its performance, which came to be called "sluggish." Numerous crashes occurred. A congressional committee chaired by future President Harry Truman examined the potential scandal. For political reasons and given the vast amount of government money already spent on the aircraft, new SB2Cs were delivered to Naval combat units beginning in December of 1942, though continuing problems delayed its being used in combat. The new Helldiver did not see its first action until a raid on the Japanese base at Rabaul, New Guinea, on November 11, 1943. Multiple new variants were developed as the Helldivers poured out of production plants. The SB2C-3 and SB2C-4 became the standard configuration, differing only in that the -4 had wing racks added to carry either 5-inch rockets or bombs and perforated dive flaps. By the time of their arrival, many of the machine's problems had been resolved but by then the aircraft had been given the name "The Beast," a nickname which stuck throughout its entire career. With more experience, pilots came to regard the machine more highly and by sheer force of numbers it gradually replaced the older Douglass SBD. However, many airman continued to prefer the older machine. Over its entire production run, a total of over 7,500 SB2Cs in all variants were manufactured.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fairey Albacore was designed and built specifically to replace the antiquated Fairey Swordfish [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Not only did it not do so, the Swordfish out-lived the Albacore in frontline combat service. The Albacore was "ordered off the drawing board" before the first prototype had flown. On paper it had great advantages over the old Swordfish: better projected performance, closed and heated cockpit, a windscreen wiper, and an automatic emergency dingy ejection system. The first prototype flew on December 12, 1938, after full production of the machine was already underway. The Albacore was found to have many problems, including a cockpit which was too hot in front and too cold in the rear, sluggish flight performance, and difficulty in its handling. Nonetheless, the machine went into operations with the Fleet Air Arm on March 15, 1940. They were deployed not only aboard British aircraft carriers, but also from land bases in the Mediterranean Theater, the western desert of North Africa, and the Indian Ocean. At their peak, Albacores equipped 15 Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. Their disappointing performance resulted in a rather short operational life. They began to be replaced by Fairey Barracuda aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in 1943. Overall, the Albacore had a very mediocre career and was never able to replace the old Fairey Swordfish.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[No single aircraft symbolizes the German "Blitzkrieg" invasion of Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France better than the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Screaming from the skies as it dropped its bombs with great accuracy, it terrified not only civilians but also soldiers who were not accustomed to this totally new lightening-like method of warfare—the Ju 87 Stuka acquired an almost legendary reputation during the first year of the war. The Ju 87 was derived from an earlier Junkers machine, the K 47. It was of all-metal construction with inverted gull wings and fixed landing gear mounted on the minimum point of the valley of the wing's depression. The Ju 87 was designed to carry a large bomb under its fuselage mounted on a carriage, which swung down to release the bomb free of the propeller arc. Additional smaller bombs were carried under its wings. Special flaps were fitted to its wings, which slowed its dive to allow for more precise bomb aiming. The terrible scream associated with the Stuka came from a wind driven siren mounted on the landing strut of selected aircraft within a unit. The Ju 87 achieved great success in the early months of the war, but when it entered the Battle of Britain and was confronted by the modern British Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires [both modeled elsewhere in this collection], the Ju 87s were easy targets and were badly mauled, requiring they either be withdrawn from bombing sorties or they be accompanied by German fighters for protection. As the war progressed, the Stuka was produced in several variants. It remained in active service until the war's end, but became increasingly obsolete and pray to Allied fighters. With the loss of German air superiority, it could hardly become airborne before being "jumped" and destroyed by Allied fighters. In the war's early years they caused fear in the hearts of Germany's enemies. By the end of the war they brought fear to the hearts of those who had to fly them. A Ju 87B is in the Battle of Britain section of the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon, England.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fairey Swordfish was probably the most remarkable aircraft of World War II. It was a true anachronism, for a while it looked ugly and awkward. The Swordfish was in active front line combat status from the first day to the final day of conflict in the European Theater of World War II. During its unbelievable and outstanding career, several more modern aircraft were designed and built to replace the Swordfish and none could do so. In fact, the Swordfish outlasted at least one of these intended successors. The first swordfish flew on April 17,1934. Although it was a new aircraft, it looked more like a hold-over from World War I—biplane configuration, fabric covered wings and fuselage, large fixed undercarriage, its minimal armament of only two rifle caliber machine guns, and speed barely better than that of World War I machines. The Swordfish was a huge and noisy biplane, but aside from being slow, it was easy to fly, stable, and able to take off and land on the small pitching deck of an aircraft carrier when no other torpedo bomber could do so. Even its low speed proved useful. German gunners consistently fired ahead of the Swordfish not believing it was flying so slow. At the beginning of World War II, Fleet Air Arm had 13 squadrons operating with Swordfish aboard five aircraft carriers plus other land based squadrons. The Swordfish participated in numerous epic engagements during World War II, where their performance was almost beyond belief for even a modern state-of-the-art aircraft, let alone for one that looked like a relic from the past. Its multitude of bracing wing wires lead to it acquiring the nickname from its adoring crews the "String Bag." Additional history on the Swordfish is given in the discussion of the other Fairey Swordfish model in this collection.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was probably the largest and heaviest dive bomber of World War II. For whatever reason, it was never well received by the United Sates military. First manufactured as a private venture by the Vultee company in the late 1930s, both England and France sent purchasing commissions to the United States after the outbreak of World War II to evaluate and subsequently place orders for the machine. The bombers that the French had ordered were diverted to Britain after France capitulated in June of 1940. The Royal Air Force named this aircraft the "Vengeance." It was a mid-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with hydraulically operated retractable landing gear and wing-mounted dive brakes. Most of these dive bombers were operational with the British Royal Air Force and the air forces of the British Commonwealth Nations. The United States Army Air Force used the machines mainly as target tugs under the identification designations of V-72s or RA-31s. The prototype of this model was operational in New Guinea with the Royal Australian Air Force and is painted in the usual earth brown and forest green camouflage employed by Great Britain and its Commonwealth Nations. For all its large size, the Vengeance was successful in its intended dive bombing role and equaled or exceeded the performance of other Allied ground attack aircraft. It eclipsed many of them in range and armament. It is surprising that it received so little acceptance in the U.S. Somewhere over 1,500 of these machines were manufactured in all of their different variants.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Douglas SBD Dauntless was the only World War II aircraft that, in the course of less than 48 hours, changed the course of the war. This is precisely what this aircraft did during the Battle of Midway when it sank four Japanese aircraft carriers in that interval of time. The sinking of these vital warships denied the Japanese their intended invasion of the island of Midway and, although the men involved did not realize it at the time and many major battles remained to be fought, it put Japan on the defensive for the remainder of the war. The Dauntless was designed by Douglas engineers Jack Northrop and Edward Heinemann. It first flew in April of 1939. Despite being underpowered and having only marginal maneuvering characteristics, the machine went on to establish unequalled World War II records—including the sinking of more tonnage of Japanese shipping than any other Allied aircraft. The Douglas SBD became the standard by which all naval dive bombers were to be judged. It acquired the name of "Barge" by its naval flight crews. When bombing, the aircraft was aimed directly at its target, usually in a 70° dive. When the bomb, which was carried beneath the fuselage, was released, the pilot pulled his aircraft out of the dive without much effort since his aircraft was now relieved of the weight of the bomb. The Dauntless was also employed by Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Free French. The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was intended to replace the Dauntless but it really never did. Many Navy airmen preferred the older Dauntless to its newer pretender. Production of the Dauntless ended in July of 1944 after more than 5,900 had been manufactured.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Douglas designed and built the TBD Devastator on a specification issued by the United States Navy in 1934 for a new aircraft carrier-based torpedo bomber. The new Douglas machine was an all-metal monoplane with partly-retractable landing rear [the wheels were half exposed when retracted]. Flight trials went very well and orders for the TBD quickly followed. The first production aircraft were deployed to active Naval units in October of 1937. At that time, the TBD was the most advanced naval torpedo bomber in the world. But by the time of the United States' entry in World War II, the TBD was already obsolete. In the early months of the war at the Battle of the Coral Sea, Devastators torpedoed and sank the Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō. The aircraft's next major engagement was at the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, when 35 TBD-1s [modeled here] attacked the four Japanese aircraft carriers deployed in the large task force bound to invade the island of Midway. During their torpedo attacks, the slow-moving TBDs were shot to pieces by Japanese Zero fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and by anti-aircraft fire. However, the destruction of these TBDs provided an indirect beneficial aspect to the battle. The attacking TBDs drew down the Japanese fighter cover of the fleet so that when the Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection] arrived shortly thereafter, they were given a free hand in their dive bombing attacks on the Japanese Carriers—an attack unperturbed by fighter opposition. The Dauntless attack was devastating, sinking all 4 of the Japanese carriers and changing the course of the Pacific war. The vulnerability of the Devastator was made obvious at the Battle of Midway and soon thereafter they were all withdrawn from combat service and replaced by the Grumman TBM Avenger [modeled elsewhere in this collection].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Despite its modest performance abilities and the fact it was the last Japanese carrier-based bomber to have a fixed landing gear, the Aichi D3A1 was a very remarkable aircraft. It was the first Japanese aircraft to bomb an American target. On December 7, 1941, 126 Aichi D3A1s [Allied code name "Val"], constituting the majority of Japanese attack aircraft, inflicted the greatest damage to the United States Pacific Fleet during the attack to Pearl Harbor. Japanese pilots flying the Val succeeded in dropping 80% of their bomb loads on target during the first year of the Pacific war sinking the largest number of Allied warships of any Japanese aircraft type including the British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes and the cruisers HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire. The machine made its maiden flight in 1938, but developmental difficulties required modifications that delayed its deployment to the fleet until early 1940. The aircraft was manufactured throughout the duration of the war with 1,495 units being completed. They remained in combat status until the Japanese capitulation, but were gradually replaced in front line dive bomber service by the more modern Yokosuka D4Y [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The final role of the Aichi D3A was that of a Kamikaze suicide bomber in attacks against the Allied Pacific Fleet. 	]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Avenger was probably the best naval torpedo bomber of World War II. It became famous for many reasons, including being the aircraft in which George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States, was flying when he was shot down in action against the Japanese. The first Avenger was flown on August 1, 1941, and the first production aircraft began equipping United States Navy torpedo squadrons shortly thereafter, replacing the aging and obsolete Douglas TBD Devastators [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The TBF Avenger saw its first action at the Battle of Midway. Of the six that were committed to that battle, only one returned and it was shot to pieces with a dead crewman and one badly injured. Not a good start for what was to become a great World War II aircraft. However, Midway was the only battle that the Avenger lost. From Midway on, the machine became the destroyer of Japanese ships and German U-boats. The prototype XTBF-1 was ordered by the U. S. Navy in 1940 and first flew in August 1941. It was of all-metal stress skinned construction with a fully enclosed cockpit. The fuselage had a rear gun turret and interior weapons bay to hold a torpedo or bombs. Using hydraulic power, the Avenger's wings folded along the side of its fuselage, as did most other Grumman monoplane carrier aircraft. It thus saved space on the Carrier's decks. Over the course of the war, the Avenger was produced in many different variants for many different roles, but its main service was as a torpedo bomber—the mission for which it was built. During the course of the war a total of 9,839 of all variants were built. In order for Grumman to concentrate their production capacity on the F6F Hellcat, production was transferred to General Motors, Eastern Aircraft Division, which built 7,546 TBM's. Of those, 921 were sent to the British Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm under the lend-Lease program. Overall, the Avenger was a superb fighting machine and it established an unequaled war record. Following the war, the Avenger served for a few more years with the U.S. Navy and with multiple other navies of the world including Japan's.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[During the early years of World War II, this aircraft was the best aircraft carrier-based torpedo bomber in the world. Some 144 Nakajima B5N2s [Allied code-named "Kate"] took part in the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. They inflicted great damage on American battleships at anchor in the harbor on that day—"a day which will live in infamy." The B5N2 project began in 1935 with a Japanese Imperial Navy specification for a new torpedo bomber with very ambitious qualities. Development of the new bomber was under the direction of Nakajima's engineer Katsuji Nakamura. The first prototype took to the air in January 1937 and met all of the Navy's requirements. The machine went into production and B5N1s [the first of the two variants that were built] began equipping operational units early the following year. The bomber's combat debut was as a conventional horizontal bomber in the Sino-Japanese war, where it achieved great success. With experience gained in the Chinese campaign, a larger engine was fitted into a newer variant, the B5N2. The B5N2 first saw combat in the Pearl Harbor attack. It is one of these aircraft which is modeled here. The Kate was active in all Japanese naval operations throughout the entire war. As newer Allied fighters appeared, the superiority of the B5N2 faded and they began to sustain severe losses. Yet, they remained in active operation until the final days of the war. A total of 1,149 of both variants were manufactured.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fairey Barracuda was another British aircraft designed and built with the intention of replacing the old Fairey Swordfish and the newer Fairey Albacore [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Barracuda replaced the Albacore but not the old Swordfish. The Barracuda originated from a 1937 specification from the British Air Ministry for a new single-wing, high-performance, naval carrier-based torpedo bomber. Like the Fairey Albacore, the Barracuda was specifically intended to replace the aging Fairey Swordfish biplane, and like the Albacore, it failed to do so. The Barracuda was an all-metal, high-wing monoplane with a complicated system of wing flaps designed to slow its speed during landing, to assist in take off, and to stabilize the aircraft during its torpedo and bombing attacks. The priority-given fighter and bomber production slowed the building of the Barracuda. It was the spring of 1943 before Barracuda IIs, the variant manufactured in the greatest numbers [and modeled here], first began to equip operational units of the Fleet Air Arm. Barracudas made history when 42 of the machines dive bombed the German battleship Tirpitz on April 3, 1944, heavily damaging the ship and keeping it out of the war. However, the Barracuda had a problem that plagued it throughout its entire operational career—it was overweight with the equipment that had been added to the machine since its original design. This placed a huge strain on its long slender landing gear, which often proved to be too weak, resulting in frequent crashes during rough landings on aircraft carrier decks. Nonetheless, as the war progressed, the Barracuda completely replaced the Albacore and largely replaced the old Swordfish as a torpedo bomber although the Swordfish remained very active in other combat roles for the Fleet Air Arm carrying on until the very end of the European war. Overall, the Barracuda was a satisfactory torpedo and dive bomber if not an outstanding one.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Without question, this was the most versatile aircraft of World War II—aside from close combat dog-fighting and very heavy bombing, it fulfilled just about every other role. The machine was built by Junkers in response to a 1935 German Air Ministry specification for a new fast medium bomber. Little did the Ministry realize that what they got would be used in an array of variants for many different purposes. Furthermore, it became the basis for several newer aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection], although these new variants were slow in coming due to the excellent performance of the Ju 88 itself. It was so good that German leaders saw no need for a newer machine. The Ju 88 entered service with the Luftwaffe in 1940 as a medium bomber, but was quickly modified into a fast long-range reconnaissance aircraft, a torpedo bomber, and later into a night fighter. The Ju 88A-17 modeled here could carry two torpedoes and was used against Allied convoys in the Mediterranean Sea during the North African, Sicilian, and Italian campaigns. The Ju 88 was clearly better than its fellow bombers in the Luftwaffe—the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17 and Do 217 [all modeled elsewhere in this collection]. During the career of the Ju 88, which lasted throughout the war, no fewer than 60 different versions of the machine were built. The precise number of Ju 88s that were manufactured before and during the war is not documented with precision but, including all its variants over 8,000 were known to have been built. The Ju 88A-17 is the Ju 88A-4 converted to carry torpedoes. The data provided is for the A-4.]]>

<![CDATA[The Blenheim Mk IV was a direct descendent of the Blenheim Mk I [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was developed from lessons learned by operational experience gleaned from its predecessor. The most obvious external difference between the Mk I and the MK IV was in the nose of the Mk IV, which was longer to provide better accommodations for a navigator/observer and had an asymmetrical depression in its port side to improve visibility for the pilot over the longer nose. The IVs served with the Royal Air Force, but were also exported to Finland, which was involved in a bloody war with the Soviet Union after the latter invaded their much smaller neighbor. The prototype of this model is one of these Finnish machines engaged in the winter war with the Soviet Union. It has the white and ice blue camouflage coloration commonly used by the Finnish Air Force on its aircraft—usually operating over the snow-covered winter landscape of Finland.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In the 1930s, Germany designed and built a number of aircraft that were ostensibly to be used as civilian transports. They were, in fact, machines that could be easily converted into bombers for military use. The Heinkel He 111 was such an aircraft and it went on to be the principle bomber of the Luftwaffe during the early phases of the war and during the Battle of Britain. It remained in frontline service throughout the entire war seeing action in every theater of operation. The Heinkel He 111 was first produced in 1935. The He 111 H version [modeled here] had an unusual asymmetrical nose, which was almost entirely glazed. The offset was to provide the pilot better visibility the nose crew position. The bomber saw first combat with the Condor Legion supporting the Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. At the outbreak of World War II, the Luftwaffe had over 800 He 111s in service. The machine served during the entire war and was built in 75 different variants, serving not only as a bomber but also as a reconnaissance aircraft, air ambulance, glider tug, and as an anti-shipping attack bomber. Construction of the He 111 continued up until the end of the war and, including all versions, it totaled over 7,300 machines. The He 111 H-6 was one of the most widely used versions with torpedo capability as well as regular bombs. The He 111 was noteworthy because of its ability to absorb substantial battle damage and still be able to return to its base. However, it had short comings—too slow and too little defensive fire power. The Heinkel He 111's career lasted well beyond World War II. After the war, the machine was built on license in Spain for the Spanish Air force and remained in service there into the mid 1960s. Numbers of these Spanish He 111s were repainted in World War II German camouflage and markings and stared in the 1960s movie film The Battle of Britain. Because of all of the variants, reliable performance data on any specific variant is difficult to establish. The data provide is typical for the H series.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the backbone of the British Royal Air Force Bomber Command during the first two years of World War II. It was designed using the system of "basket weave" geodetic construction developed by the famous British engineer Barnes Wallis. This was the system of construction used successfully in the Vickers Wellesley [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The geodetic methodology gave the aircraft great strength at much less weight. It also allowed the machine to absorb a great deal of combat damage and to still be airworthy. The Wellington was built in response to a 1932 Air Ministry specification for a new medium bomber. It first flew in June 1936, was accepted by the Royal Air Force, went into production, and began equipping bomber squadrons the following year. At the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939, Wellingtons were deployed on a bombing raid of German shipping just seven hours after the declaration of war. Early experience proved that the Wellington could not survive in daylight bombing against modern German fighters. It was subsequently shifted to nighttime bombing with the realization that bombing at night was far less accurate. In the latter months of 1941, Britain's three heavy four-engine bombers were becoming available to the Royal Air Force for its nighttime bombing. The Wellingtons then found new careers in reconnaissance, transport, and training. They continued to serve with distinction throughout the entire war. Some 11,461, including all of its several variants, were manufactured. The Wellington Mk III modeled here is in the typical night bombing camouflage used by the Royal Air Force.]]>

<![CDATA[It is difficult to believe that two industrial world powers could have such a disparity in their military forces as did France and Germany at the outbreak of World War II. Yet, this was the case, especially in the area of bomber aircraft. While the Germans had modern high performance bombers, the French had hopelessly obsolete, box-shaped, under-powered, slow, poorly maneuverable machines with grossly inadequate defensive armament. The Amiot 143 was typical of the type of bomber with which France entered World War II. First flown in August of 1934, six bomber units of the Armée de l'Air were still equipped with these obsolete machines in September of 1939 when the war began. During the early months of the war, they were used to drop propaganda leaflets over Germany, but when Germany invaded France in May of 1940, Amiot 143s were used in their intended roles as bombers. In one such raid on the bridges of Sedan on May 14, 1940, eleven of the twelve attacking Amiot 143s were shot down by modern German fighters. Clearly these obsolete bombers were of a bygone era and no role in modern warfare. Following French capitulation in June of 1940 the Germans, for a short time, employed ten of the surviving Amiot 143s as transports until they gave up on the machines altogether.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[When Germany invaded France in early May of 1940, the brief Battle of France that followed was a disaster for France and Great Britain. France was invaded and lost its freedom. Great Britain lost many men and much equipment. One of the causalities of that battle was the light bomber, the Fairey Battle [modeled here]. The squadrons of Fairey Battle aircraft sent to France at the outbreak of the Second World War to support the British Expeditionary Force were virtually annihilated by modern German fighters. Indeed, their losses were so severe that the machines became flying coffins for their aircrews. When the first Fairey Battle flew on March 10, 1936, the machine was much heralded and was a marked improvement over the Hawker Hart [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which at that point was the Royal Air Force's main light bomber. However, by the onset of the war they were hopelessly miscast in their role as a bomber. Although larger in size, the overall appearance of the Battle was not much different from the Hawker Hurricane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. In fact, the two aircraft had the same power plant. Yet, the Battle was nearly a 1,000 pounds heavier, had three crewmen and was designed to carry 1,000 pounds of bombs. This extra weight with the same power plant as a fighter meant that the Battle was slow and had a poor performance. Against the Messerschmitt Bf 109s [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the Battle had no chance and they were shot out of the sky in horrible numbers. In one bombing sortie on one day, 40 out of 70 Battles were destroyed. After less than a month, the few Battles that had not been decimated simply had to be withdrawn from their role as bombers. They were all withdrawn to England where they were retired, became trainers or target tugs.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The German Navy launched its new Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin on December 8, 1938. The German Air Ministry issued specifications for a new torpedo bomber to serve on the new vessel. Fieseler responded with the Fi 167. It was a quite large biplane, which in its early trials proved to have excellent performance. It was somewhat similar to the British Fairy Swordfish torpedo bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in its size, but the Fi 167's performance was much superior. However, the construction of the Graf Zeppelin was suspended in 1940 and, after some additional months, the entire Graf Zeppelin project was canceled. The role for which the Fi 167 had been designed no longer existed. The 12 pre-production aircraft that had been built were transferred to a testing facility in the Netherlands, where unimportant studies such as the evaluation of different over-water camouflage schemes were being conducted. Several of the machines were subsequently given to Romania where their fate is unrecorded. Performance data is limited.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Designed by Jack Northrop and Edward Heinemann of the Douglas Corporation, the A-20 made its first flight on January 23, 1938. Because of a lack of orders from the United States Army Air Force, production of the new machine lagged until Europe drifted towards war and the French and the British, both in need of aircraft, placed orders for the A-20s. Throughout its career, the A-20 had the interchangeable names "Havoc" and "Boston." One of the shortcomings of the machine was the narrowness of its fuselage, which prevented movement of the crew within its interior. Should the pilot become unable to fly, the other two crewmen had no choice but to bail out. As the war progressed, a large portion of the A-20s total production of 7,385 was consumed by Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands, leaving much smaller numbers for the United States Army Air Force. As a result, the A-20s operational history with the United States Army Air Force was somewhat meager. The A-20 flew in almost all theaters of the war under the colors of many different Allied Nations. The armament carried by the machine varied widely depending upon the mission of the bomber and the country for which it was operating. The A-20 performed well in many roles, but was especially effective in the role for which it was originally designed—low level ground attack in the support of ground forces. After the war, numbers of these aircraft remained in service with the United States Army Air Force until they were finally retired in the early 1950s.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The B-25 was one of the most successful aircraft of World War II. It was active in every theater of the war and was flown not only by the United States but also by the British, by British Commonwealth Countries, and by the Soviet Union. The project that created the B-25 began in 1938, when the United States Army Air Corps issued a specification for a two engine medium bomber. North American engineers produced an outstanding machine. It first flew in January of 1939, its potential was immediately recognized, and the B-25 went into production. The name "Mitchell" was given to the bomber in the memory of General William "Billy" Mitchell, the early advocate of military air power. Numerous modifications were made during the career of the B-25 in a constant upgrading of the basic airframe. Including all of its many variants, over 11,000 B-25s were produced during World War II. While it was involved in many important missions during the war, its most famous was the attack on Tokyo by 16 B-25s flying from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet on April 18, 1940, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While the attack did little actual damage, it provided an enormous psychological boost to the American public, which had had nothing but bad news since the entry of the United States into the war. The other famous event surrounding the B-25 was when one flew into the New York City Empire State building in a heavy fog. However, these sensational events did not tell the real story of the B-25, which flew with great distinction throughout the war making consistent and huge contributions to the American war effort. A large number of B-25s remained in service with the United States military after the war, and even longer with the air forces of some smaller nations. Indeed, there are still B-25s flying in the 21st Century, more than 60 years after their production. The B-25J (modeled here) was frequently modified with a solid nose containing eight forward-firing, 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Mitsubishi company designed and built this aircraft in response to a mid-1930s specification issued by the Japanese Army for a light attack bomber and ground support machine. The resulting aircraft featured a number of firsts: first double-row radial piston engine, first variable-pitch propeller, and first internal weapons bay. It was one of the first military aircraft which was purely Japanese and had not been designed and built with heavy influence from western technology. The first prototype flew in February of 1937 and production machines, which totaled 704, began equipping Japanese Army units several months thereafter. Despite the machines new innovations, its performance was only modest at best. It was used widely in the Sino-Japanese war in the ground attack role supporting advancing Japanese troops. It was initially faced with little or no enemy fighter opposition in the Chinese theater of operation. However, by late 1942, the Ki-30s had become obsolete even for service in China where Allied Curtiss P 40 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] had begun to appear. The remaining Ki-30s were thus withdrawn to the Japanese home islands where they served the remainder of the war as trainers.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built as a private venture, but it came to fulfill a 1931 British Air Ministry specification better that the Ministry's original request for a biplane bomber. Impressed with the monoplane's trials compared to a biplane submitted for the same specification, the Air Ministry ordered the new monoplane bomber naming it the "Wellesley." It had a single radial engine and an exceptionally long wingspan. Its two crewmen were housed in non-connecting, separate canopy-covered cockpits. Its bombs were carried in pods beneath the wings. A total 176 Wellesleys were built. By the outbreak of World War II in September of 1939, Wellesleys were no longer operational with Royal Air Force Bomber Command squadrons based in England. However, Royal Air Force Squadrons in Aden, Asmara, East Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Sudan, and Transjordan still flew the machine. It is one of these Middle East Wellesleys based in Sudan that is modeled here. These overseas Wellesleys saw substantial action during the early months of the war but were gradually replaced by more modern bombers. They were all retired by 1944.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Two Ki-15 prototypes were built, one civilian and one military. The civilian model, registration J-BAAI manufactured by Mitsubishi, put its parent company on the aviation map and made world history in 1937, when its pilots Masaaki Iinuma and Kenji Tsukagoshi flew a record-setting flight from Tachikawa [west Tokyo] to London in 51 hours. In recognition of the new aircraft's speed, the Japanese called it Kamikaze ["Divine Wind"]. This term took on a grim meaning during the later months of World War II, when Japanese suicide bombers, using that same name, attacked United State naval forces and caused many American deaths. Several more civilian Ki-15s were built under the name Karigane I. The military version was also produced as the Ki-15-1 and a naval version C5M1 and C5M2 [Allied code-named "Babs"- modeled elsewhere in this collection]. They were used as reconnaissance platforms for both the Navy and Army until late 1942, when they were retired. However, during the last days of the war as Japan was being encroached upon by United States naval forces, some of the old C5M2 military aircraft and a few of the remaining old Ki-15 civilian machines were reactivated and used in the role of their namesake—Kamikaze. Just how many were used in this role or just how successful they were is unrecorded.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Walter Blume and Hans Rebeski, engineers at the Arado Flugzeugwerke Company began work on a turbojet-powered reconnaissance bomber in November of 1940. It was revolutionary in concept and design. It was to be so fast that no enemy aircraft could catch it, making defensive armament unnecessary. Their plans were submitted to the German Air Ministry in early 1941 and were accepted for development. Thus began the era of jet-powered bombers. The machine was exceptionally clean with a smooth flush-riveted stressed metal skin. A tapered wing was mounted on top of a slender fuselage with an engine nacelle under each wing. In the nose was a single-seat cockpit that was entirely glazed with Plexiglas. The new machine's high fuel consumption meant that the entire mid-section of the fuselage was occupied by a huge fuel tank. Trouble with the development and production of the aircraft's new Junkers turbojet engines delayed the machine's first flight until June 15, 1943. With the narrow fuselage center section devoted to fuel, there was no place for landing gear so the aircraft took off from a trolley that was then jettisoned. Landing took place on skids, which prevented it from taxiing. This proved impractical and the Ar 234B was introduced with a wider fuselage and conventional landing gear. The first flight of the B version, the most numerous in production, did not take place until March 10, 1944. A sighting periscope was introduced along with bomb racks and drop tanks. The aircraft's Hi-Tech cockpit was well arranged, but was difficult if not impossible to exit in an emergency. In July 1944 prototype Ar 234 aircraft began operations in the reconnaissance role. In October of 1944, the B-2 variant of these machines began to fly combat bombing missions. Bombs were carried outside the airframe—one under the centerline of the fuselage and one under each engine nacelle. Even when loaded, the aircraft's performance was excellent and it became very popular with its pilots. The total production of all versions of the Ar 234 was 210 units. Due to its late arrival in the war, the machine's combat career was brief and had little overall impact. Had it appeared sooner and in greater numbers the course of World War II might have been different.]]>

The A-26 first flew on July 10, 1942, and deliveries to the United States Army Air Force began in mid 1944. The A-26 was the high point in the development of twin-engine light attack bombers by the Douglas Company with 2452 of all variants being built. They saw action in both the European and Pacific theaters in several different roles: light bomber, ground support, anti-shipping, reconnaissance, and photography. By the time the A-26s entered service in 1944, the United States Army Air Force had abandoned camouflage and were leaving their new warplanes in natural polished metal finishes. The A-26 bomber remained in U.S. service long after World War II, well through the Korean and Vietnamese conflicts. Engine information and performance varied by block number. Based on the serial number on the model, the aircraft was an A26-15-DT built at Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the data is specific to that block number.]]>

<![CDATA[The Mosquito was one of the truly great aircraft of World War II, although its beginnings were tenuous to say the least. Had it not been for the persistence of its designer Patrick Hennessy of the de Havilland Company, along with the support of the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, this outstanding machine might not have seen the light of day. What turned out to be one of the most effective warplanes of World War II went largely unappreciated during the early days following its design. Not until it made its first flight in November 1940 did it get the attention of Royal Air Force leaders. Built entirely of wood, it was very light for its size. When this aerodynamically superb airframe was combined with two powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, the best of their kind in the world at the time, the result was a near-perfect light bomber with such dazzling speed that it could out fly and leave behind any Axis fighter of the time [no defensive armament was installed on the aircraft]. The machine's first RAF service began in November of 1941 and continued throughout the remainder of the war, making many daring tree top attacks with pin point accuracy on German targets throughout Europe. The Mosquito was manufactured in no fewer than 32 different variants, although the basic external contour and the basic construction of the machines remained unchanged. Mosquitos served not only as bombers but also as reconnaissance and photographic platforms. Some of its most famous attacks included those on German Gestapo Headquarters in Oslo and The Hague. Given their great speed, they also played an important role in intercepting and destroying German Fieseler Fi 103 V-1 "Buzz Bombs" [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Mosquito was employed by all of the Allied Air Forces and following the war were used by 13 different countries well into the era of jet aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was built originally as a civilian mail plane in 1933 but was modified, as were several other German inter-war aircraft, for military use. The machine's very slim fuselage made for cramped crew accommodations. Modifications to the early versions were required before the aircraft was accepted by the Luftwaffe. The Do 17s first combat was in the Spanish Civil War, where its performance was quite good. With experience learned in that conflict, the Do 17 was further modified resulting in the Z variant, which was the most numerous and successful, and featured a deepened glazed nose. The Luftwaffe had 352 of these bombers in operational service at the time of the German invasion of Poland and the beginning of World War II. Although the Do 17 was initially used extensively, it was slower and carried a lighter bomb load than the other two German medium bombers used during the early months of WWII, the Junkers Ju 88 and the Heinkel He 111 [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Thus, as the war progressed, the Luftwaffe began phasing out the Do 17 transferring many of them to their allies. The aircraft modeled here flew for the Croatian Air Force. With the advent of the Do 17's successor, the Dornier Do 217 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the Do 17s were largely withdrawn form the bombing role and were either given to allies, scraped or used as utility aircraft, transports, or target tugs.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This three-engine bomber was one of the very important Axis aircraft of World War II. While it was originally designed and built as a horizontal bomber, it found its most effective role as a torpedo bomber in operations over the Mediterranean Sea while attacking Allied shipping. The SM.79 was a member of the family of Savoia-Marchetti bombers, whose linage goes back to the early 1930s. Italian aircraft designers preferred the three-engine format and the SM.79 followed this plan. It first flew in October of 1934 as a civilian transport, but was quickly transformed into a bomber by the Regia Aeronautica and began equipping its units shortly thereafter. There, it was given the official name of "Sparviero." The SM.79 first saw combat when flying for the fascist Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. When Italy entered World War II as Germany's ally in June of 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had 594 SM.79s in service. These machines remained in action throughout the war and following Italy's capitulation in September of 1943, SM.79s flew for the Co-belligerent Italian Air Force along side Allied aircraft. A few also flew for the puppet government of Northern Italy that remained under German control. Following World War II, SM.79s were active with the post-war Italian Air Force until 1952 when they were finally retired.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was built at the Glenn L. Martin Middle River plant just North of Baltimore, Maryland, the state from which the machine derived its name. It was designed for the United States Army Air Force as a light reconnaissance bomber, but after its initial flights it failed to gain acceptance with the U.S. military. With the worsening situation in Europe and with promises for quick deliveries from Martin, the French Armée de l'Air ordered 175 of the machines. Seventy-five had been delivered to France by the time of the French capitulation to Germany in June of 1940. The majority of these became a part of the newly created Vichy France Air Force and operated in the former French colonies in the Middle East and in North Africa. It is one of these Maryland 167s that is modeled here. The remainder of the original French order was diverted to Great Britain, where the bombers flew with the Royal Air Force and for British Costal Command. They were used primarily in reconnaissance roles. It was one of these Maryland aircraft which over-flew the Italian Naval Base at Taranto, Italy, gathering information for the subsequent British night attack on that base by the Royal Navy aircraft carrier Illustrious' Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. That attack destroyed much of the Italian Mediterranean Fleet and changed the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean for the remainder of the war. Maryland aircraft eventually came to equip three RAF squadrons and four South African Air Force squadrons.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was derived from the Lockheed 14 Super Electra, an all-metal passenger airliner that was designed and built by the Lockheed Corporation in the mid-late 1930s. With an approaching war in Europe, the British Royal Air Force was in need of a light reconnaissance bomber. With its own aircraft industry taxed to the limit, it turned to Lockheed in the United States requesting it modify its passenger airliner into a military machine. The first such bomber, which the British named "Hudson," flew on December 10, 1938. Its performance was deemed adequate and production orders were placed by Great Britain. The Hudson looked much like the civilian 14 Super Electra, except for its armament including a dorsal powered gun turret. During the months leading up to World War II and during the early months of the war, the Royal Air Force took delivery of over 1,500 Hudson aircraft using them in an array of roles: bomber, maritime reconnaissance bomber, multi-engine trainer, and transport. The United States also acquired the Hudson—the Army called it the A 29 and the Navy the PBO 1. A Navy PBO 1 based at Argentia, Newfoundland, was the first U.S. military aircraft to sink a German submarine on March 15, 1942. Like the British, the Americans used the Hudson in a variety of roles. These machines labored on in the American, the British, and other Allied Air Forces throughout the entire war. Following the war, numbers of them were converted back into civilian use and were active for many more years.]]>

<![CDATA[like many Italian bombers, this machine had three engines. It was designed in 1935 as a civilian transport, it was very successful and established many speed and endurance records of the time including a distance record of 3,345 miles in 1937. The machine's military value became immediately obvious and production was ordered by the Regia Aeronautica with the first aircraft to equip its units arriving in 1937. The machine was built entirely of wood with a mixed wood-and-canvas covering. Its floats were of metal. In October of 1937, a Regia Aeronautica CANT Z.506 set a new world trans-Atlantic distance record by flying non-stop 4,362 miles from Cádiz, Spain, to Caravelas, Brazil. The aircraft's combat debut came in the Spanish Civil War where it performed well. At the time of Italy entering World War II on the side of Germany, 97 of these machines were operational with the Regia Aeronautica. Over the subsequent years, a total of 324 of these aircraft would be manufactured, the vast majority for military use. While it was employed mainly as a naval reconnaissance platform, it also served as a bomber, torpedo bomber, convoy escort, and as an air-sea rescue aircraft. In fact, some of these aircraft remained active in this latter role with the Italian Air Force into the 1960s when they were finally retired.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Handley Page in response to a British Air Ministry specification issued in 1932 for a new medium bomber. Responding to the same specification, the British aircraft company Vickers designed and built the Vickers Wellington [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Both machines were put onto production, although it is difficult to understand how these two machines could look so different while answering the same specification. Despite its rather antiquated appearance, the Hampden gave fairly good performance with better speed than the Wellington. The first Hampden flew in May of 1938. The first deliveries to an operational unit of Bomber Command began the following September. When World War II broke out in September of 1939, ten RAF squadrons were equipped with Hampdens. However, the shortcomings of the aircraft were made obvious when on September 29, 1939, a group of 11 Hampdens bombed the Heligoland Bight area near the German coast. Five of the group were lost to German fighters. The Royal Air Force Bomber Command soon withdrew the Hampdens from all daylight missions and confined them to night bombing. The Hampdens, while having a good airframe, suffered throughout their career with engine trouble. In an effort to correct this, the Hampden was modified and given two Napier Dagger engines in place of their Bristol Pegasus. This version, which externally was indistinguishable from the Hampden, was named the Handley Page Hereford. However, its performance was no better and the Napier Dagger engines proved no more reliable than the Pegasus. By the winter of 1939-1940, the Hampdens had been relieved of almost all bombing missions and were deployed in mine laying operations and were used as trainers.]]>

<![CDATA[In response to a request from the United States Army Air Force in January 1939 for a high performance medium bomber capable of great speed, a heavy bomb load and good range, the Glenn L. Martin Company of Middle River, Maryland, developed the B-26, later called "Marauder" by the Army Air Force. It made its maiden flight on November 25, 1940. High performance and high wing loading made it difficult to fly. As a result, there were frequent flight accidents, which made it initially very unpopular with flight crews. But with experience, time, and modifications, it became an extremely effective aircraft and one of the best of its type. Indeed, it had one of the lowest combat loss rates of any World War II aircraft despite its participation on all fronts in every theater of operation. Over 5,000 of all variants were manufactured between February of 1941 and March of 1945. It was one of the outstanding medium bombers of the World War II.]]>

<![CDATA[The British Air Ministry issued a specification for a new twin-engine trainer in 1936. Airspeed Ltd. won the contract for 136 AS.10 Oxfords. The Oxford first flew on June 19, 1937, deliveries to the Royal Air Force began in November of that year. Of wooden construction and with retractable landing gear, the Oxford accommodated instructor and pupil at duel controls. It was also used to train navigators, bomb-aimers, camera and radio operators. Some versions [not the prototype of this model] had an Armstrong-Whitworth dorsal gun turret for gunnery training. With the outbreak of World War II, there was an enormous demand for these machines for a verity of training and utility roles. They were employed by not only the British Royal Air Force and British Coastal Command, but also by the Free French Air Service, the U.S. Army Air Force, and several British Commonwealth nations. The demand for Oxfords was beyond the capacity of Airspeed, so numerous other British firms built the machine—a total of 8,586 being manufactured. They remained in RAF service until 1952, well after the war. The Oxford was truly one of WWII's most successful training aircraft]]>

<![CDATA[The "Reliant" series of aircraft had been manufactured by the Stinson company in the mid and late 1930s as a civilian light transport. Upon the entry of the United States into World War II, numbers of these civilian machines were purchased for service with the Army Air Corps, they were given the designation of UC 81 and were used in an array of duties. Stinson continued to build the machines for the United States military, but the British Royal Navy was the biggest wartime operator of these aircraft, obtaining over 500 of them under the Lend-Lease program. They were used in many roles. The aircraft modeled was employed in the airborne evaluation of the effectiveness of the camouflage of vital instillations and factories. The Royal Navy also employed these aircraft in navigation and communications training. After very busy wartime careers, at the war's end, some 415 British Reliants were returned to the Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia, where they were eventually sold as surplus on the civilian market. The engine and performance data represent the AT-19 (V-77) configuration.]]>

Its first sales were to civilian airlines, but the Royal Air Force purchased its first Rapides in 1935 using them as light transports and as communication and general utility aircraft. Many commercial Rapides were impressed into duty with the Air Transport Auxiliary. Military production was begun in 1940 under the designation DH.89B Dominie. They were used as navigation and communications trainers and light transports, a function which they fulfilled throughout the remainder of the war. A total of 728 Rapide/Dominies were manufactured until their production was stopped in July of 1946. Numbers of these machines continued in RAF service after World War II until the last were finally retired in 1958, after long distinguished careers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Curtiss Hawk family of fighters was basically of sound machines. However, as they were being designed, modified, and built, so were other fighters around the world, especially in Europe and the Unites States. The Curtiss Hawk 75 could simply not compete newer designs and, while over 1,000 were built, they never achieved the status of an outstanding fighter. Nevertheless, these aircraft were available at a time when the world was gearing up for World War II and at a time when many countries of the world were desperate for fighter aircraft. This created a large market for Curtiss, which not only sold some Hawks [designated P 36s] to the U.S. Army, but also exported Hawks to France, China, Argentina, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Finland. Indeed, the Hawks became an international fighter. Although the Hawk was not as fast as the German Messerschmitt Bf 109, it was an excellent gun platform, stable, with a very good turning radius and roll rate. The first Bf 109s shot down by the French in WWII were by Hawk 75s. Their success ratio was higher than that of 109, but they were vastly out numbered. The Hawk's performance and effectiveness soon lagged behind their immediate competitors—the British Spitfire and Hurricane, the Bf 109, and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 [all modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Thus, history places the Curtiss line of Hawk fighters in the shadow of these other better performing and more important machines.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the first Focke-Wulf aircraft designed by the famous aviation engineer Kurt Tank. The first machine flew in 1933. It was of mixed fabric, metal, and plywood covering over a steel tube frame. Multiple alterations to airframe and power plant were required after the aircraft's maiden flight, delaying its first delivery to the Luftwaffe until 1935. The machine was employed in the original flight testing of Ernst Udet's concept of dive bombing, a technique that proved so successful that was used by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas [modeled elsewhere in this collection] during the German invasion of the Low Countries and France. The Fw 56 was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter and dive bombing training schools during World War II. Numbers of these machines were given to Germany's allies for use in training their combat pilots. This model represents a trainer in use with the Hungarian Air force and has Hungarian markings.]]>

<![CDATA[The Tiger Moth (DH.60T) was begun in 1931 as a private business venture by the de Havilland Company. It was exported overseas to Brazil, China, Egypt, Iraq, and Sweden. Orders for The Royal Air Force flying Schools soon followed after modifications to meet Specification 15/31. Additional improvements were made over the next 15 years, including a better engine. The Tiger Moth became the main primary trainer for the Royal Air Force. It was the machine upon which almost all World War II British and Commonwealth pilots had their primary flight training. The machine was employed in no fewer than 28 RAF flying schools in Great Britain, 25 in Canada, 12 in Australia, and 4 in Rhodesia. With the outbreak of World War II, Tiger Moths were sent to France where they functioned in observation and communication roles including providing these functions during the British evacuation at Dunkirk in June 1940. During the dark days following Dunkirk, when England was in danger of being invaded, some Tiger Moths were actually fitted with armaments although, none of these machines actually saw combat. Tiger Moths remained flying well after the war and a few are still flying in the 21st Century, over 70 years after their first introduction.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Thousands of American airmen during World War II had training in this aircraft. It was an intermediate trainer used to continue the indoctrination of young pilots before they began flying high performance fighters or before they went to multi-engine flight schools. It was one of the most widely used trainers of all time. This machine was designed and built by the General Aviation Company of Dundalk, Maryland [which subsequently became North American Aviation] in response to a 1935 United States Army Air Force specification for an advanced trainer. With the advent of World War II, the demand for the aircraft was so intense that manufacturing was transferred to a new North American plant in Dallas, Texas. Over the ensuing years, the aircraft was built in at least 16 different variants—the differences were in power plants and internal equipment. The external appearance varied very little. The Army termed the aircraft the AT-6 [and higher AT numbers], while the Navy termed the aircraft SNJ. Both services used the term "Texan." The Texans were common sights at American flight schools. They were also used by Britain and Canada and were identified as Harvards. Later versions were produced in Canada. The total production of all versions in the U.S. and Canada exceeded 15,000.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the first monoplane trainer employed by the Royal Air Force, whose previous trainers had all been biplanes. The Magister was also unique in that it was the first RAF trainer to be of all-wood construction with an all-plywood covering. Early models of the Magister were prone to enter into uncontrolled tail spins, causing a number of fatal crashes. Modifications to the rear fuselage and tail plane corrected this problem. The Magister's production ran from its first flight in 1937 until late 1941 with a total of 1,229 being built for the Air Ministry, with additional aircraft produced for overseas orders and civilian use prior to the war. This aircraft went on to be a valuable elementary trainer for the RAF throughout World War II. In June of 1940, when a German invasion of England was feared and British warplanes were in very short supply, a number of Magister aircraft were given guns and racks for small bombs so they could be used in combat. However, none were ever deployed in this role.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was the last German bi-winged fighter. Developed in the very early 1930s, the first prototype of the Ar 68 flew in 1934. The fuselage was of steel tube construction covered with metal panels. The wings were of wood with plywood and fabric coverings. The distinctive tail fin, introduced on the Ar 68, became almost a standard feature on all subsequent Arado single engine aircraft. Both BMW and Junkers engines were tried on five different prototypes during development. Initial production was begun with the 68-F modeled here, utilizing the BMW VI 12-cylinder, Vee inline engine of 750 hp (570 kW). When availability of the Junkers Jumo 210Da engine was assured, production was switched over to the 68-E model. Although the Junkers engine was of less power, it had better high altitude capability and was installed in an inverted position that provided improved forward visibility. Delivery of the 68-F to Luftwaffe units began in the late summer of 1936 and the machines were in significant service thereafter. By the outbreak of World War II, most Ar 68s had been relegated to fighter pilot training units where they continued to serve in this role for most of the war. However, some served as night fighters during the early months of the European conflict until they were replaced with more modern aircraft. The performance data provided is for the Ar 68-E1.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was designed as an Army cooperation aircraft to be operational in the support of ground forces. It performed many roles during World War II. The Lysander was designed and built by the Westland Company in response to a 1934 Air Ministry specification for a reconnaissance battlefield support aircraft to replace the Hawker Audax and Hector currently in service in this role. Both of these were biplanes and were obsolete. The first Lysander flew on June 15, 1936. After successful flight trials, production contracts were signed and the first Lysander aircraft began equipping Royal Air Force squadrons in June of 1938. At the outbreak of war in September of 1939 there were seven RAF squadrons flying the Lysander. The machines were sent to France in support of the troops in the British Expeditionary Forces. However, it was soon found that there were very heavy unacceptable losses in the Army cooperation squadrons flying the Lysanders—they were being shot out of the sky in droves by the modern German fighters. The Lysanders had to be withdrawn from their original intended role of close support Army cooperation. Numbers of them were sent to the Middle East where there was less enemy fighter risk. Three variants were produced. The original Lysander had weapons attached to the lateral planes protruding from the spats of its fixed landing gear. These were often fitted with bombs, cannon, or machine guns, although the Lysander never achieved fame as a ground attack aircraft. The Mk III variant [modeled here] did achieve fame as a short takeoff and landing [STOL] platform and was used extensively in the nighttime interdiction and extraction of Allied espionage agents into and out of German occupied Europe. Some of the Mk III machines [such as the one modeled here] had a ladder mounted on the port side of the fuselage beneath the canopy for the quick exit and retrieval of agents. The engine was always kept running during the few seconds the Lysander was on the ground during these clandestine landings. The ladder sped up the exchange of its passengers. During its entire production run, a total of 1,368 Lysanders of all variants were built.]]>

Developed during the 1930s, their machines came to be major assets for the United States military leading up to and following the entry of the United States into World War II. The Traveler [modeled here] was one of a number of civil aircraft adapted for the role of light transports and Army co-operation aircraft. The model 17 was known as the "Staggerwing" because its lower wing was forward of their top wing—a rare arrangement in biplane aircraft. Introduced in 1932 and continuously improved in succeeding years, the Staggerwing developed enviable reputation. A total of 117 of various models were impressed into military service in addition to at least 270 procured by the military services—the Army Air Force designated them UC-43, while the Navy labeled them GB-1or GB-2. The RAF received 106 aircraft identified as Traveler Mk I. The Staggerwing was fabric-covered, except for the forward fuselage, and was painted in an overall dull olive drab. Later aircraft were left with just the metallized weather coating, which confused many who thought all the exterior skins were metal.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1942, high ranking officers of the British Army made a request for a new small short takeoff and landing [STOL] aircraft which they could use as their personal machines. A British government specification for such an aircraft was issued. It specified that the aircraft not only have STOL capability, but that it be able to fly from rough tree surrounded fields and in most all weather conditions, be maintained in the field by only semi-skilled personnel, and be simple enough to fly so that it could be piloted by aviators with only marginal experience—in all, a tall order. Yet, George Miles, founder of the aircraft company bearing his name, fulfilled the specification with the M.38 Messenger. The Messenger first flew September 12, 1942, just three months after the design began. It was an immediate success, but the Royal Air Force initially took little interest in the little machine and it was almost a year later that it finally ordered 21 of the aircraft for the use of senior military leaders, including Montgomery [as mentioned above] and Marshall of the Royal Air Force Arthur Tedder. Nineteen of these machines survived the war and were subsequently sold into private service.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the second most important bomber in the Soviet Air Force during World War II—second only to the Ilyushin Il-2. It was designed by Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev while he was incarcerated in a Soviet political prison. He had been sent there by Joseph Stalin for alleged espionage. His good work for the Soviet Air Force in aircraft design later earned his release. The Tu-2 first flew on January 29, 1941, just five months before the German invasion. Multiple modifications, including replacement of its original power plants, were required, causing a delay in it being put into production. Deliveries of the Tu-2 to the Red Air Force began in December of 1943 and gradually increased from the Soviet factories, which had been moved east to avoid the German invasion. A total of 1,111 machines were produced during World War II, another 1,300 after the war. The Tu-2's combat performance was outstanding combining an appropriate balance of speed, agility, bomb load, and defensive armament. In fact, the Tu-2 was deemed to be so good that it remained in service with the Soviet Air Force and the air forces of several communist countries through the Korean War and into the late 1950s.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This medium bomber was designed and built by the Soviet aviation company founded by Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev. The SB-2 began equipping bomber units of the Red Air Force in late 1934. It made its combat debut in the Spanish Civil War flying for the Republicans. Its performance in that conflict was impressive, although it was rarely confronted by truly modern fighters. The SB-2 was not only deployed by the Soviet Air Force, but was sold to Finland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and China. The latter was in war with the invading Japanese in the mid and late 1930s and was in need of bomber aircraft. It is one of these Chinese SB-2s that is modeled here. Soviet Tupolev SB-2s took part in the 1939-1940 winter war with Finland. Ironically, those Tupolev SB-2 aircraft, sold to Finland before the start of the Soviet-Finnish War, were flying for Finland—a case where the same machine was flying for both opposing forces. By the beginning of World War II in September of 1939, the SB-2 was showing its limitations and was becoming obsolete. They, nonetheless, continued in active combat status with the Red Air Force as medium bombers until 1943, when they were converted to night bombers, transports, target tugs, and multi-engine trainers. A total of over 6,600 Tupolev SB-2s were produced.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Ki-48 was built by Kawasaki to fulfill a December 1937 specification from the Japanese Imperial Army for a light bomber that could perform like the Soviet Tupolev SB-2 bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Japanese were so impressed with the performance of the SB-2 that they wanted a similar machine for Japanese use. The project was undertaken by Kawasaki engineer Takeo Doi, the same man who designed the Ki-45 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The first prototypes of the Ki-48s took to the air in July of 1939. Problems arose in test flights including severe vibrations in the tail sections requiring fuselage revisions. The first production aircraft did not begin equipping combat units until the summer of 1940. With the advent of Japan's entry into World War II, the Ki-48 proved inadequate when confronted by Allied fighters, and even the instillation of improved armament and more powerful engines could not bring the machine to competitive levels. As the war progressed, the Ki-48 was only modestly successful in its intended role of light bomber. Despite its inadequacies, including all of its variants, a total of 1,408 Ki-48s were built before their production was stopped in October 1944.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In the early 1930s, the Polish military had a significant interest in ground attack aircraft to support their ground forces. In response to a 1931 specification issued by the Polish Army, the aircraft company Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze [PZL] designed and built the PZL.23. It was an all-metal, single-engine, low-wing machine with a crew of three. Delays in design were such that it first flew in August of 1934. Production of the PZL.23 began in 1935. The "b" variant [modeled here] was produced in the greatest numbers with 210 being built. PZL.23s were also sold to the Bulgarian Air Force. At the time of the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the Polish Air Force had 12 operational units equipped with 118 PZL.23s. During the short Polish conflict, those PZL.23s that were not destroyed on the ground in the early hours of the German assault, performed well, though they were outclassed by German fighters. The bravery of the Polish airmen had as much to do with the success of the machines as did their performance. The deployment of these machines during the brief Polish-German war was under the strict control of local Polish commanders. Thus was lost much of the advantage, which the PZL.23s might have provided had they been more effectively managed in a coordinated manner.]]>

The M.S.225 was of mixed metal tubular frame construction with metal covering of the forward fuselage, a metal engine cowling, and fixed undercarriage and spats over its wheels. Tail planes and wings were fabric-covered. The M.S.225 began equipping fighter units of the Armée de l'Air in 1934 and they remained in active service until 1938, when they were replaced by more modern monoplane fighters. By the time of the outbreak of World War II, there were no M.S.225s in active service with any Armée de l'Air fighter escadrille. However, numbers were still assigned to flight training schools as advanced trainers for French fighter pilots. Following the French capitulation to Germany in June of 1940, all M.S.225s were scraped, neither the Vichy French Air Force nor the Luftwaffe having any interest in them.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This is one of the smallest aircraft modeled in this collection. The L-4 Grasshopper was originally designed in the late 1930s by the Piper Aviation company as the "Piper Cub," a civilian private light personal transport and sport airplane. With the worsening of the European situation and the beginning of World War II, the United States Army perceived the need for a reconnaissance aircraft to support its field artillery and ground troops. It acquired the Piper Cub for these roles. The small machine was a braced high-wing monoplane of mixed metal, wood, and fabric construction. The cabin was in a tandem arrangement for the pilot and observer. The L-4 fulfilled the Army requirements and was subsequently manufactured in several variants, which all had the same external appearance and differed only in their internal equipment. The L-4s served throughout the war in all theaters but were mainly used in the European theater. Two other light reconnaissance aircraft were also employed by the Army, both were very similar to the Piper L4. They were the Aeronca L 3 Grasshopper, and the Taylorcraft L 2 Grasshopper. In fact, all three of these little "Grasshoppers" had the same power plants, about the same dimensions, and functioned in the same role. Aside from some minor differences all three of these aircraft were almost impossible to tell apart. For this reason only the Piper L 3 was modeled for this collection since it was employed in the greatest numbers. The prototype of this Piper wears the typical olive drab overall color. As was the case with all Allied aircraft involved in the Normandy "D" Day invasion, this Piper has the black and white recognition stripes on its wings and fuselage.]]>

<![CDATA[Prior to the advent of this aircraft, American observation and reconnaissance machines had been open cockpit, fixed landing gear biplanes. When the Unites States Army Air Corps issued a specification for a new reconnaissance machine, North American designed and built a very different airplane. It was all-metal, it had a long fully enclosed glazed cockpit, and retractable landing gear—all unique features in a reconnaissance aircraft of the time. The original specification for which the plane was built was issued in 1934 with the first prototype flying the following year. The O-47s began equipping Army units in 1937. By the time of the United States' entry into World War II, most of these machines had been retired or were in service as observation trainers or target tugs. However, a few were still in service with units overseas such as the prototype of this model, which was assigned to an active unit in the Philippines at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Along with other American assets in the Philippines, they were destroyed in the Japanese invasion.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Curtiss Aircraft Company responded to a United States Navy specification for a new reconnaissance aircraft in 1937 with its SO3C Seagull. It was of all-metal construction except for its control surfaces and was built with interchangeable under carriage—wheels for land use or with a large central float and wing-tip out rider floats for water use. The first prototype flew on October 6, 1939, and from the start the machine had very poor in flight stability. This was partly resolved by the introduction of upturned wing tips, but the aircraft continued to have numerous ongoing faults. An unusual feature of the aircraft was that the forward portion of its tail fin protruded over the rear of the cockpit glazing, so that when that section of the cockpit hatch slid forward the forward section of the tail fin went with it. The first Seamew entered service with the cruiser USS Cleveland in July of 1942. Despite their shortcomings, a total of 756 Seagulls were built. One hundred went to the British under the Lend-Lease program as Seamew's, but none were used operationally. Instead, the British employed them as trainers. The unsatisfactory performance of the SO3C led to its withdrawal from service in favor of better reconnaissance aircraft during 1943 and 1944. To avoid confusion with an earlier Curtiss aircraft also called the Seagull, the current practice is to identify all versions of this aircraft as the Seamew, even though that name was never used by the U. S. while the aircraft was in service.]]>

Landing gear retracted into wheel wells in the sides of the central float when airborne and when taxing in water. The wings were of light alloy with fabric covering and had out-rigger floats positioned beneath each tip. The pilot and the observer shared the glazed cockpit in a tandem arrangement. There was also a space beneath them, complete with windows on both sides, where the lower fuselage and central float joined. This could be used by a third crew or for a rescued flyer if needed. The first prototype of the amphibian flew on May 4, 1933. Finding the machine to have good performance, the United States Navy order 27 of them. The first were not delivered to operational Navy units until 1936. The Ducks were employed in reconnaissance, air-sea rescue, and general utility duties throughout the war.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the United States Navy's first monoplane shipboard reconnaissance aircraft. It was designed and built by Vought to replace the older biplane machines then being deployed aboard American battleships and cruisers. The Kingfisher first flew in a wheeled land-based configuration in March of 1938. The floatplane variant flew just two months later. Its tests were successful and production began with the first production machines entering service with the Navy in August of 1940. The main variant was the OS2U-3 [modeled here]. It was employed as a shipboard reconnaissance platform throughout the war serving in all theaters of U.S. Navy operation. A total of 1,006 of this variant alone were built during the war. The Kingfisher was also based at shore facilities, where in was used in reconnaissance and air-sea rescue roles. Many American pilots survived the war after being rescued by a Kingfisher. The Kingfisher would often have to remain on the surface and taxi back to the nearest shore base after collecting the downed airman—it was unable to take off with the survivor clinging to its central float. Overall, this was a very successful aircraft that performed its intended role with distinction. Kingfishers continued in service aboard American warships until they were replaced by helicopters in the early 1950s.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was the last biplane manufactured by Curtiss to be in operation with the United States military. Its performance was so outstanding that several more modern machines intended to replace it had a very difficult time doing so. In some cases they never did. SOC Seagulls remained in active service throughout the entire war surviving many other designs. The first Seagull flew in April of 1933 and deliveries of the production aircraft began in November of 1935. From the beginning, it was recognized as an exceptional machine. It was of mixed construction with its wings and tail covered with metal and a steel tube framed fuselage was covered with metal and fabric. A large central float was positioned beneath the fuselage and out rigger floats were attached beneath its wing tips. Three variants were produced, the SOC-3 [modeled here] being the most numerous. Production of the Seagull was terminated by Curtiss in 1938, when that company began producing the new Curtiss SO3C Seamew [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. But when the latter's performance proved to be so poor and they were withdrawn from service, all available remaining Seagulls were pressed back into service for the remainder of the war. The prototype of the SOC-3 modeled here was deployed aboard the cruiser USS Phoenix when it was in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The USS Phoenix was one of the few United States warships that was able to weigh anchor and leave the harbor during the Japanese attack thus escaping any damage [years after World War II, the USS Phoenix was transferred to Argentina and while serving with the Argentine Navy during the Falkland Island War, the cruiser, renamed Belligrano, was torpedoed and sunk by a British submarine with the loss of nearly all hands].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Design of this reconnaissance flying boat began in the late 1930s at the Blohm & Voss Company under the direction of that company's engineer Dr. Richard Vogt. Substantial delays were encountered due to its unusual structural configuration and problems with its power plants. A prototype [BV 138A-0] made its first flight in February of 1939, but shortcomings required multiple further modifications. Production of the aircraft finally began in October of 1940 and the machines were equipping operational units soon thereafter. Their unique shoe shaped fuselage led to their nickname "Die fliegende Holzschuh" ["the flying clog"]. The BV 138 operated primarily from shore bases but a few were assigned to seaplane tenders. The aircraft served in most all theaters of the war—Norway, the French coast, the Bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the North Atlantic, and Artic oceans. While reconnaissance was its main role, its armament was excellent making it a significant marine attack bomber. The prototype of this model had a camouflage scheme, which was unusual for German aircraft. Most German warplanes had a geometrical pattern of straight lines employing two colors on their upper surfaces, not the wavy line disruptive pattern of this flying boat. However, this scheme proved highly effective along the northern shoreline of Norway. An interesting bit of history surrounding this machine occurred during the final days of the war, when a BV 138 landed under heavy gun fire on a lake outside Berlin with the mission of flying Hitler's last will and testament out of Berlin. The BV 138's commander would not let the couriers aboard because they lacked proper identification. Instead, he flew 10 wounded soldiers back to Copenhagen, Denmark. Overall the BV 138, although not looking much like a warplane, had an outstanding war career.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Junkers Ju 88 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was the basis for the Junkers Ju 188 modeled here. The Ju 88 had been so successful that the Luftwaffe leadership saw no reason for up grades to what they felt was a wonderful machine—but with time a decision was made to improve the aging Ju 88. The first Ju 188s flew early 1943 and their first combat was on raids over England in August of that same year. The new Ju 188 was a cleaned up version of the Ju 88 with much the same bulbous glazed nose and thin fuselage, but with sharply pointed wing tips. The Ju 188's performance was not that much improved over the older Ju 88. The Ju 188 was built in a number of different variants for bombing, reconnaissance, photoreconnaissance, torpedo bombing, and as a pathfinder for larger bombing formations. The aircraft modeled here was a reconnaissance aircraft patrolling the North Atlantic, usually with accompanying bomber versions, for Allied convoys which, when identified, would either be attacked or reported to German U-boats. It has the FuG 200 Hohentwiel radar. As the war progressed and Allied bombing began to take a toll on German industry, the Luftwaffe's priorities shifted to the production of fighter aircraft. In the implementation of this policy, Junkers Ju 188 production was terminated in the spring of 1944 after 1,076 of all variant types had been manufactured.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Gerhard Fieseler, the founder of the Fieseler aircraft company, was a 22 victory ace of the German Air Force in World War I. His company designed and built the Storch as a short takeoff and landing reconnaissance aircraft. It was successful beyond its designer's wildest dreams. The Allies had no machine which even came close to the Storch's performance. It could take off fully loaded in just 150 feet and with a brisk breeze blowing it could land in just 15 feet. It was immune from fighter plane attack because it was capable of flying at only 32 mph without stalling—attacking fighters were unable to fire on such a slow moving target. The Storch could go anywhere, land on almost any field, and do almost anything. It accompanied the German Army on all of its operations in every theater throughout the entire war. One of the Storch's final missions was the evacuation of senior personnel from Berlin, which was completely surrounded by Soviet troops. The machine landed in a Berlin street. After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September of 1943, Italian partisans captured Benito Mussolini, the former Italian dictator, and imprisoned him in a hotel atop a peak in the Abruzzi Mountains. Its only access was by cable car. Hitler ordered SS Haupsturmführer Otto Skorzeny to rescue Mussolini. The operation was carried out successfully when a Storch landed and took off with Mussolini using a tiny terrace at the rear of the hotel as a landing strip. Such were the exploits of this amazing aircraft. The precise number of these machines that were manufactured during the war is lost in history, but approximately 2,900 were delivered to the Luftwaffe. The production of the Storch resumed following the war and these aircraft became a part of the air forces of many nations as well as serving in many civilian post-war roles.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Providing catapult reconnaissance aircraft for the battleships and cruisers of the Royal Navy was one of the responsibilities of the Fleet Air Arm. The Fleet Air Arm issued a specification for a float plane to serve in this capacity in 1936, and in response the Fairey Aircraft Company designed and built the Fairey Seafox. It was a twin float aircraft with a metal fuselage, fabric-covered wings, and the unusual arrangement of an open cockpit for the pilot but a covered canopy for the after seated observer/ gunner. Production aircraft began equipping Royal Navy capital ships in April of 1937. They remained in service as catapult reconnaissance machines until in 1942, when it was replaced in this role by the American-made Vought OS2U Kingfishers and British Fairey Swordfish [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Seafox perhaps saw its greatest moment in World War II in December of 1939, when one of them [modeled here] was deployed on the British Light Cruiser HMS Ajax which, along with the Australian Light Cruiser HMS Achilles and the British Heavy cruiser HMS Exeter, engaged the German "Pocket Battleship" Admiral Graf Spee in the first major naval battle of World War II. In that action off the Río de La Plata in South America, the Fairey Seafox of HMS Ajax spotted for the gunfire of the British cruisers, which damaged the Admiral Graf Spee forcing it into the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay. Trapped there, the German Captain of the Admiral Graf Spee scuttled his ship thus ending the encounter and giving the British their first major naval victory of World War II.]]>

<![CDATA[This model represents an aircraft of the Coastal Command No. 228 Squadron, Gibraltar, Mediterranean Theater, June 1943.]]>
</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[This was the largest and most famous flying boat in British service in World War II. It was derived from a civilian passenger transport that Short Brothers had built for Imperial Airlines. The Sunderland was larger, had more powerful engines, and a longer range than its predecessor. It was designed and built in response to a 1933 Air Ministry specification for a long range reconnaissance flying boat. The Sunderland's designer was Arthur [later Sir Arthur] Gouge. His new aircraft first flew on October 16, 1937, and began service with Coastal Command in June of 1938. From the beginning, it was recognized as a very fine machine with the long range and performance need for its reconnaissance duties. Within its vast two-deck hull, it was fitted with the extensive crew accommodations needed for long flights. It carried bombs, depth charges, or mines in its fuselage, which were run out on tracks beneath its wings and then dropped on targets below. At the outbreak of World War II, some 40 Sunderlands were in service. They immediately were deployed in an anti-submarine role—a role they performed throughout the entire war. Most Sunderlands, such as the one modeled here, were equipped with ASV Mk II radar. Its porcupine-like aerials can be seen on the sides and dorsal area of the fuselage of this model. In view of the Sunderland's defensive armament, the Germans gave it the respectful nickname "the flying porcupine." A Sunderland made the reconnaissance flights over Taranto, Italy, before the British performed a night attack on that base by Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. These aircraft, flying from the carrier HMS Illustrious, severely damaged the Italian fleet and changed the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean for the remainder of the war. The Sunderland performed many other heroic deeds during the war, sinking many German submarines while on patrol. It was a truly outstanding aircraft. Numbers of them were converted to civilian passenger service after the war, flying for British Overseas Airways and QANTAS Australian Airlines.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Avro Anson had one of the longest production runs of any British aircraft or, for that matter, any aircraft in history. It was produced from 1934 until May 1952. Its origins began with a request by British Imperial Airways for a four-seat passenger transport. The British Air Ministry requested changes be made in the civilian machine to make it suitable for military use. This included instillation of a dorsal machine gun turret along with other revisions. The first Anson joined No. 48 Squadron of the Royal Air Force on March 6, 1936. In addition to Ansons for the RAF, contracts were obtained for export to Australia, Egypt, Ireland, Estonia, Finland, and Greece. The Anson became one of the RAF's standard trainers with the onset of World War II. As German bombing of England reached its height, manufacture of the machine was taken up by Federal Aircraft Ltd. of Canada. During the war, the machine went through multiple changes and revisions thus creating new Marks [Mk], but the airframe and the aircrafts main appearance remained stable. The Anson was used for maritime patrol during the early months of the war. As the war progressed, the machine was used more for training and less for military operations. The Anson went through a total of 21 Marks [Mk] or versions before production ceased in 1952, but the aircraft remained in active service with the RAF until all machines were finally retired on June 28, 1968—an exceptional 34 year career probably exceeded only by the United States' Douglas DC-3 [modeled elsewhere in this collection].]]>

<![CDATA[This machine was designed by Reginald Mitchell, the famous aeronautical engineer of the Supermarine Company who designed the Supermarine Spitfire [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The machine was designed and the first prototypes were built as a private venture by the Supermarine Company. The aircraft first flew on June 21, 1933. Its test flights were totally successful and the Royal Australian Navy ordered 25 of the machines. They later came to equip the Australian warships HMAS Australia and HMAS Sydney. In July of 1933, the British Royal Navy began testing the aircraft at its Felixstowe facility and found it to be very satisfactory. Twelve were immediately ordered and the flying boat was given the rather unromantic name "Walrus." It began equipping Royal Navy battleships and cruisers as their reconnaissance aircraft. By the time World War II broke out, most British capital ships had Walrus aircraft aboard them. In January 1940, all the shipboard reconnaissance aircraft in the Royal Navy were placed in a single Fleet Air Arm Squadron—No. 700 Squadron. It was doubtless the most diverse squadron in British service in that it was deployed virtually around the world on British warships. Numbers of Walrus aircraft also flew from shore bases around the British Empire in anti-submarine patrols carrying bombs. Other Walrus aircraft performed air-sea rescue duties. One shore-based squadron alone rescued 598 survivors. The ancient-looking flying boat was revered by its crews who came to call it the "Shagbat." The machine was sturdy, could tolerate substantial damage, and could takeoff and land in very heavy seas. It served aboard 55 British, Australian, and New Zealand ships and established a distinguished reputation for reliability and service not achieved by many World War II aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Towards the end of World War I, Claudius Dornier, the founder of the Dornier Company developed an interest in large flying boats. The long landing fields required for the take off and landing of the larger and heavier airplanes of the time were expensive to build and were rare. Water take off and landing was cheap and unlimited—thus the interest in flying boats. The Doriner Company developed several such machines during the 1920s culminating in the Do J Wal, which first flew in November 1922. The machine had excellent performance and established several aviation records for endurance flights. The successor to the J was the Do J II, which first flew in the early 1930s. The new machine was built in several variants, the Do J IId being the military variant that had an open cockpit and three open defensive machine gun positions. Civilian versions of the Do J II established regular trans-Atlantic mail service to South America in the mid-1930s. By the time of the outbreak of World War II, the majority of the Do J II Wals had been replaced by more modern Dornier flying boats in both civilian and military service. However, a few of the old Do J IId Wals remained in service in the Baltic Sea area [which was well removed from any Allied fighter aircraft] during the first months of World War II. They were used in a reconnaissance, anti-submarine, and air-sea rescue roles.]]>

<![CDATA[The Ar 196 was the standard catapult launched reconnaissance aircraft carried aboard German capital ships during World War II. They also served in the coastal areas of Hitler's Europe not only in the reconnaissance role but, due to their heavy armament, as attack aircraft. The machine was of metal and fabric construction with a low-mounted wing and a tight engine coiling with blisters over the valve gear. It was a rugged aircraft stressed for catapult launching and built for landing in heavy pitching seas. Deliveries to the Kriegsmarine began in June of 1939 and the aircraft immediately became popular with its crews due to its performance and handling qualities. The Ar 196 went through various revisions and changes throughout its operational career and remained in production until August 1944. An Ar 196 was aboard the "pocket battleships" Admiral Graf Spee, Admiral Scheer, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, the super battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz, and the cruisers Lützow and Prinz Eugen when these capital ships were engaged in separate sea actions with British Royal Navy units.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This fragile looking biplane is the aircraft that has had the longest production run and was built in the largest numbers of any machine in aviation history. Soviet records state that from the time of its design by Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov and its first production in 1928 until the conclusion of its production in 1952, an astounding 40,000 were built. Whether that figure is accurate could be open to question, but what is without question is that this remarkable little machine was built in huge numbers before, during, and after World War II. It resembles a World War I aircraft with its exposed control plane wires, its cowling free engine, and with its inter-wing struts and bracing wires. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the Po-2 was in active service with reconnaissance units of the Red Air Force. Pressed for aircraft of all kinds, the Soviets also used the Po-2 as a light attack bomber in the support of ground troops. Three Night Bomber Regiments using Po-2s had women pilots who became known as "Die Nachthexen" ["The Night Witches"] for their aggressive and efficient tactics. It was also widely used for reconnaissance surveillance. The machine served throughout the entire war as a Soviet trainer. Indeed, most Soviet pilots had their elementary training in this aircraft. The Po-2's flight stability and safety were so outstanding that for decades following the war it remained in use throughout the Soviet Union's flight training schools. Numbers of Po-2s remain flying in the 21st Century as sport aircraft and with aviation clubs.]]>

<![CDATA[This biplane was manufactured as a reconnaissance aircraft with ground attack capabilities. Fokker envisioned its market for the machine would be the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The Fokker C.X first flew in 1934. It was of mixed wood and metal construction. Some of these aircraft were sold to the Netherlands and others were sold in export. When Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939, it was in great need of aircraft and purchased 39 of the C.Xs and built 35 more under license. Their performance against the Soviets was quite remarkable considering the age and the obsolete nature of the machines. Some of these surviving aircraft remained in the Finnish Air Force after World War II, continuing to be operational until 1958, 24 years after they first entered service. The Dutch machines did not fair as well. Many were destroyed on the ground when Germany invaded the Netherlands in May of 1940. Those that did get into the air were shot to pieces by the Luftwaffe. None of the Dutch Fokker C.Xs survived the war. The C.X was built with a variety of engines, both in-line and radial, the Finnish prefered the radial.]]>

Several changes in power plants and airframe occurred over the following months creating several sequential version or Marks [Mk]. Whitleys began the "shooting" war on the night of October 1, 1939, on a bombing mission over Berlin. However, with only modest performance and becoming obsolete, these machines were retired from Bomber Command in April 1942 and continued their careers as marine reconnaissance aircraft, glider tugs, target tugs, transports, and utility aircraft. Some were used at No. 1 Parachute Training School at Ringway, Manchester. Other Whitleys were assigned to No. 138 and No. 161 Squadrons based at RAF Tempsford and flew sorties dropping agents into the occupied territories of Europe along with dropping arms and equipment to resistance forces. Fifteen Whitleys were striped of armament and turned over to British Overseas Airways Corporation [BOAC] for use as transports on the Gibraltar to Malta route.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was, without question, the most outstanding marine reconnaissance aircraft of World War II. It served with distinction in every theater of operation, under all conditions, for several Allied nations and could not be replaced from its prominence by more modern machines, which were designed to do just that. Its origins began in 1933, when the Consolidated Company responded to a United States Navy specification for a new long-range flying boat. The Catalina was of all-metal construction. Its wing floats retracted upward when in flight becoming wing tips. Over the ensuing years no fewer than 13 different variations of the machine were built not only in the U.S. but also under license in England, Canada, and the Soviet Union. The "Cat," as it came to be called, was not young when the U.S. entered World War II. Several hours before Japanese aircraft arrived over Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to begin their attack, a PBY spotted the periscope of a Japanese submarine off the coast of Hawaii. The "Cat" vectored in an American destroyer which subsequently sank the submarine—the first blood shed by an American enemy in World War II. Perhaps the most famous episode involving a PBY was the finding of the German battleship Bismarck in the North Atlantic; a discovery which enabled a strong British Royal Navy surface task force to engage and sink the Bismarck. Prior to and during the war, over 3,000 PBYs of all versions were built. Later variants had retractable wheels added making them amphibious. The PBY-5A modeled here is such a variant. The PBY-5A was one of the more numerous versions produced and is identified by the large Plexiglas bubble on each side of the rear fuselage. This served as a gun port but also as a port of entry and exit to the machine. The much loved "Cat" served not only as a reconnaissance aircraft but also in anti-submarine warfare, as a transport, for communications, and for photography sorties. Its air-sea rescue services were epic—many downed airman owed their lives to the PBY. The Catalina's only shortcoming was its low speed. Nevertheless, its endurance partly made up for this given the machine had a very long range. Many PBYs had civilian careers following the war and a few remain flying today.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built in response to a 1933 German Air Ministry specification for a new battlefield reconnaissance aircraft to replace the Heinkel He 46 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The result was a large machine with a parasol single wing configuration that gave its two-men crew an excellent view of the ground. The first production Hs 126s were delivered in 1938. Like so many other pre-World War II German aircraft, the Hs 126 went to Spain with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. Its performance there was excellent and the Hs 126 began equipping numbers of Luftwaffe units that took part in the invasion of Poland. During that brief conflict, there was a near lack of Polish fighter aircraft opposition, but in the subsequent invasion of France, the French and British fighters found the Hs 126 to be an easy target. The machines were gradually withdrawn in favor of Focke-Wulf Fw 189 reconnaissance aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. A few Hs 126s were used in North Africa, the Balkans, and on the Soviet front but they were finally all removed from battlefield reconnaissance and relegated to secondary roles before their final retirement. Total production of the Hs 126 was about 600 machines.]]>

<![CDATA[This machine was the largest and most powerful seaplane deployed in World War II [the distinction of seaplane versus flying boat must be clarified—the seaplane has two floats in place of the wheeled under carriage of the land plane, while the flying boat has a boat shaped fuselage, thus the name "flying boat"]. It has no floats except for small out riggers under each wing to stabilize the hull while in the water. The first flight of the He 115 was in August of 1937. The machine proved to be strong, have good performance, and few faults. The He 115 had a weapons bay in the bottom of the fuselage that could hold sizeable amounts of bombs, depth charges, or a torpedo. The machine was ordered by the Luftwaffe and by 1938 it had received several dozen. Numbers had also been exported to Norway and Sweden before the outbreak of World War II. After the war began and during the German invasion of Norway, several of the Norwegian He 115s escaped across the North Sea to Great Britain, where they flew for the Allies under British Royal Air Force direction. Since they were German-designed machines and could pass as Luftwaffe aircraft, the RAF used some of these He 115s for interdiction of agents onto the shorelines of German occupied countries in Europe and North Africa. Although the Germans designed the He 115 as a naval reconnaissance aircraft, the machine performed in a large variety of other roles: mine laying, attack, and torpedo bombing against Allied shipping, air-sea rescue, and meteorological tracking. Overall, it proved to be a reliable and sturdy aircraft and one of the finest seaplanes of the war. A total of 138 of all variants were manufactured.]]>

The machine's unorthodox configuration featured an asymmetric layout with its engine being installed in the forward end of a port side tail boom and an extensively glazed crew nacelle mounted to the starboard. The first prototype flew in February of 1938. Multiple modifications were made to the machine before several production machines were built. The main stumbling block to the acceptance of the aircraft was its very unusual configuration. The starboard horizontal stabilizer was cut short to the point that it was almost non-existent, this to apparently not obstruct the line of fire of the rear gunner. But the unconventional overall configuration of the machine's structure made it unacceptable to Luftwaffe leaders and to Luftwaffe pilots, despite the aircraft's rather good performance. Thus doomed, the aircraft's production was very limited and was finally terminated in 1943. A single reconnaissance unit of the Luftwaffe employed the BV 141 for a short while on the Eastern front.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The German Air Ministry issued a specification for a new high performance reconnaissance aircraft in February of 1937. In response Kurt Tank, Focke-Wulf's chief engineer, designed the Fw 189. It was of a totally different design from any previous reconnaissance aircraft. It had an almost completely glazed central nacelle for its crew and its engines were mounted in front of twin tail booms. The machine's slender wings, matchstick booms, and small power plants did not inspire much optimism when first viewed. The Fw 189 first flew in July of 1938 and from the beginning, despite its appearance, its superb agility, handling, reliable engines, and smooth ride made it very popular with its air crews. The A version [modeled here] was the most numerous variant manufactured. Total production of the Fw 189 in all of its variants was 864 machines. The largest number of these were deployed on the Soviet Front, where they achieved an enviable reputation. The German name Uhu, that was assigned to the Fw 189, meant "Eagle Owl." With its many successes, Luftwaffe pilots came to dubbed it "Das fliegende Auge" ["the Flying Eye"].]]>

<![CDATA[This flying boat was designed and built by the Kawanishi Company as a long-range reconnaissance machine. It also could carry bombs under its wings and functioned during the early years, before Allied fighter aircraft were abundant, as a maritime bomber. It first flew on July 14, 1936, and was immediately proven to be a superior machine with excellent performance. Between then and final production in 1942, 215 Kawanishi H6Ks of all variants were built. The Allied code name for the reconnaissance variant was "Mavis" and for the marine transport variant "Tillie." The reconnaissance version [modeled here] had an outstanding range of over 4,200 miles—compared to a range of only 2,350 miles for the main United States naval reconnaissance aircraft, the Consolidated PBY Catalina [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The machine remained in service throughout the entire war and was only partly replaced by the larger Kawanishi H8K2 [Emily] Flying Boat [modeled elsewhere in this collection].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the main German transport of World War II. It served on every front in that German troops were engaged and performed in a large number of roles. To the German military, it became affectionately known as "Tante Ju" ["Auntie Junkers"]. The first Ju 52 flew on October 13, 1930. It was of all-metal construction with corrugated, load-sustaining duralumin skinning and had three engines. The Ju 52/3m version [modeled here] made its maiden flight in April of 1932 and was an immediate success. So successful, that almost immediately it became the principle airliner of the German Airline Lufthansa and the airlines of 32 other nations. It was the world's leading civilian airliner until replaced in this role in the later 1930s by the Douglas DC-3 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Ju 52 was of obvious military value and was in active service with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. The Luftwaffe had 552 of these machines available at the outbreak of World War II. During the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium the Ju 52s dropped paratroopers into combat, the first use of this type of military envelopment. Other famous battles in that the Ju 52 played a major role were in Norway, Denmark, North Africa, and the Soviet front. Perhaps its greatest achievements were in the airborne invasion of the island of Crete when the entire operation was based upon a fleet of 493 Ju 52s dropping paratroopers, supplies, and acting as tugs for the operations attack gliders. However, the Ju52's suffered severe losses and this was the last mission in that German paratroops were used in a mass deployment. Small improvements were incorporated throughout its production life. Although the exact number of these old war horses that were manufactured is not exactly known, it was approximately 5,000 including postwar production in France and Spain. The specification data provided is for the Ju 52/3m g7e version.]]>

<![CDATA[This model represents an aircraft of the 1 Staffel, Lufttransportchef 5, Poland, May 1944.]]>
</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[This was the largest air transport of World War II. It was derived from the huge Messerschmitt Me 321 Gigant glider [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Me 321 glider had been a partial success, but the difficulties in preparing the huge aircraft for their return trips from open rough fields that were usually their landing sites required that a large amount of specialized equipment be maintained at these constantly moving landing grounds. In an effort to make the huge transport more independent, it was decided by the Luftwaffe High Command to motorize the glider and to add a permanent under carriage, thus make its operation easier. With the occupation of France, the products of French industry became available to the Germans. While their own aircraft engines were often in heavy demand and in short supply, French engines were readily available so it was decided to place six French Gnome-Rhône engines on the Me 321 glider airframe. Probably this was a bad decision since these engines did not provide adequate power for the huge Me 323s. Further, the independence achieved with self-contained power came at a price. The six engines were heavy and the fuel that had to be carried to serve them was even heavier. This substantially reduced the effective cargo weight that could be carried by the powered Me 323 compared to that that the glider version could carry. Nonetheless, the Me 323 was put into production and large numbers were employed to bring supplies and troops to the German forces in the Soviet Union and North Africa. However, these huge machines were slow and lacked any maneuverability. They were easy targets for Allied fighters and despite the introduction of defensive armament they were shot down in droves. One Luftwaffe transport unit supplying German forces in North Africa lost all but one of its machines out of a force of 43 during operations in the spring of 1943. Unfortunately for the Germans, the fighters needed to protect these giant transports were often not available. A number of different versions with heavier armament and more power were developed in an attempt to reduce vulnerability. None were very successful. Overall, the Me 323 was only a marginal success and cost the lives of many German airmen. Nevertheless, it must be considered within aviation history as the forerunner of today's huge heavy transports like the United States' Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[If there was one World War II aircraft that never received the credit it deserved it has to be the Curtiss C-46 Comando. While it was larger, faster, could carry more cargo, had a longer range, and a higher service ceiling, it was constantly in the shadow of the other great American transport, the Douglas C-47 [DC-3] Skytrain [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The fact that the C-46 was more expensive than the C-47 probably was the determining factor in the C-47 becoming the major American transport of the war. Development of the Commando began at the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company under its chief engineer George Page in 1936. Intended to be a civilian air transport, it was an all-metal machine with its windscreen flush with the fuselage. The Commando first flew in March of 1940. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, suddenly made the Commando's obvious attributes and its fuselage's cavernous interior ideal for military service. A very large cargo door was added to the port side of the fuselage allowing for easy loading and unloading. The first military delivery of the C-46 was in July 1942. The machine was employed as a transport in many theaters of operation, but its long range and high service ceiling made it ideal for use in the Pacific. Perhaps its greatest contribution was its epic role in flying supplies and equipment over the Himalayan Mountains from India to General Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese forces and General Claire Chennault's 14th Air Force both fighting the Japanese in China. This route over the world's highest mountains and through routinely bad weather was dangerous and came to be known as "Flying the Hump." The Commando was superb in this role. Following the war, Commandos remained in U.S. military service through the Korean War and were not finally retired until June of 1968. Their civilian post-war service lasted even longer.]]>

<![CDATA[The Douglas C-47 was the most important Allied transport aircraft of World War II. A discussion of its linage is given with the model of the C-47 replicating a United States Army Air Force Transport Command Skytrain elsewhere in this collection. While they were the same machines and had the same functions as the U.S. C-47 Skytrains, the British called their C-47s "Dakotas." Both were military versions of the civilian DC-3, an airliner that first flew in December of 1935. It totally revolutionized the air travel industry and every airline in the world placed orders for the comfortable and efficient new aircraft. The advent of World War II witnessed existing DC-3s and the new production of these transports being taken over by the United States military for their use and for shipment to the air forces of the various American Allies. The C-47 took part in military operations in all theaters of the war in an unbelievable array of roles: troop transport, paratrooper drop aircraft, cargo transport, glider tug, air ambulance, reconnaissance, and countless other uses. The prototype of this British C-47 is painted in a dark olive drab and wears the usual British roundels. It was based at the RAF airfield at Hendon, England, just north of London where the Royal Air Force Museum is currently located. The previous RAF airbase has been converted into a superb world class Museum containing many of the World War II aircraft that have been modeled in this collection. It is a facility well worth visiting for those interested in World War II aviation.]]>

<![CDATA[The DC-4 was next in the line of the passenger transports designed and built by Douglas after the DC-3. While the DC-3 was the world's best airliner in the late 1930s, Douglas almost immediately began plans for a larger aircraft that would have longer range and would carry more passengers or cargo. A number of American airlines agreed to share the cost of development with Douglas. The result was a very new machine with many advanced features for its time. Even before a prototype had flown, American, Eastern, Pan American, and United Airlines had placed orders for the new transports known today as the DC-4E. Prior to production, the commercial customers decided they needed a less complex and cheaper aircraft. The resulting new design was also identified as the DC-4. However, World War II intervened and Douglas' entire production of the new DC-4 was diverted to the United States military—even before the aircraft's first flight on March 26, 1942. Twenty-four were in service with Transport Command by the following October. The machine was produced in large numbers and in different variants; the different variants were largely dictated by the machines role and desired range—the greater the required range the larger the needed fuel tank capacity. By the time the war ended, of the 1,164 C-54s built, 840 were serving with the Army Transport Command and the aircraft had completed some 80,000 over ocean crossings with a stellar safety record. Two C-54s were specially modified with extra fuel capacity giving the transport a range of 5,500 miles—the longest of any World War II aircraft. One was the personal aircraft of President Franklin Roosevelt [and later Harry Truman] and the other was provided to Winston Churchill. These flew these leaders to the various Allied meetings around the world. Churchill's C-54 was returned to the United States after the war. Overall, the C-54 was probably the finest long-range transport of World War II. Following the war, a number of civil DC-4s were produced pending the introduction of the DC-6.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was one of the finest passenger airliners of all time. It was launched by the Lockheed company in response to a request from Transcontinental & Western Airlines [TWA] for a high speed airliner with a pressurized cabin that could fly non-stop across the country with a pay load of no less than 6,000 pounds. The future billionaire Howard Hughes was a prime mover in the project that saw the first prototype fly on January 9, 1943, from Lockheed's Burbank, California plant. The large transport met all of TWA's specifications and immediately became a huge success establishing new cross-country flight times. Pan American Airways joined TWA in placing orders for the new airliner. With the advent of World War II, both these airlines waived their rights to the first production aircraft in favor of the United States Army Air Force, which began receiving them in April of 1944. The Army designated the Constellation the C-69. In January of 1945, the U.S. Army contracted with TWA to establish C-69 trans-Atlantic service and on its first New York to Paris flight the Constellation set a new record time of 14 hours and 10 minutes. At the conclusion of World War II, the military need for these excellent machines had passed and they were all sold to civilian airlines, both domestic and foreign, where the Constellation had a long and distinguished career, not being retired until the appearance of jet transports in the late 1950s.]]>

<![CDATA[Just as the Dornier Do 17 was entering service with the Luftwaffe, its manufactures proposed a new and larger machine with superior performance and better bomb carrying capacity, the Do 217. Although it was similar in appearance, it was a totally new and different machine. Approved for design, the new bomber made its maiden flight in August of 1938. The first machines joined the Luftwaffe in the Spring of 1940. Stability problems generated some modifications, but the aircraft's performance was considered excellent and its production was expanded. Multiple variants were manufactured for employment in bombing, reconnaissance, night fighting, marine patrol, and anti-shipping attack roles. Later in the war, some Do 217s were altered to carry Germany's new air-to-ground missiles such as the Henschel Hs 293 [anti-shipping] and the Fritz X. Over the duration of its production, a total of 1,730 machines were built in an array of over 50 different variants and subtypes. The Do 217, in its many forms, remained a major part of the Luftwaffe's World War II bomber force throughout the entire conflict. This model represents an anti-shipping variant deployed in the English Channel and the North Sea. Accurate performance data for a specific variant is difficult to define because of the large number of variants. Performance data provided is for the 217M version, which had similar performance to the K versions even though it was powered with Daimler Benz 603A inverted inline V-12 liquid-cooled engines.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Nakajima in response to a 1938 Japanese Imperial Army specification for a bomber with a range of 1,800 miles, a speed over 300 mph, and a bomb load of 2,000 pounds. The first production Nakajima bombers built to this specification began equipping combat units no sooner than three years later [in late 1941] because the Army changed its collective mind on several occasions during the development process, and at one point insisting that the new aircraft be built and armed as a long range fighter. The fighter concept was withdrawn but the entire process consumed substantial time. The Ki-49 never fulfilled the expectations held for it. There were many problems—it had unreliable engines and inadequate defensive armament made it vulnerable to Allied fighters. The Ki-49 entered service in the autumn of 1941 on the China front. Despite its faults, a total of 819 Ki-49 were produced in a number of variants between March of 1941 and December 1944. They saw action in almost all theaters of Pacific.]]>

<![CDATA[The Halifax was the second four-engine heavy bomber to enter service with the Royal Air Force Bomber Command after the Short Sterling [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which had entered into active service just 3 months before. The Halifax became second only in importance to the Avro Lancaster [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in the British night bombing raids on Germany. The Halifax first flew on October 29, 1939, just a few weeks after the outbreak of World War II. The first machines to equip Bomber Command began arriving in November of 1940, and the Halifax made its first bombing mission almost a year later, on the night of November 10-11, 1941. From that raid until its final raid of the war on the night of April 24-25, 1945, Halifax bombers flew 75,534 missions, dropping 227,000 tons of bombs on European targets. The British Royal Air Force Bomber Command adopted a policy of bombing at night. The American bombing force bombed during daylight, thus subjecting Germany and its occupied countries to "around-the-clock" bombing attacks that destroyed the German industrial base and Germany's ability to wage war. In addition to being an excellent bomber, the Halifax proved to be very versatile. It served in the role of transport, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, glider tug, and paratrooper transport. The Mark I and II versions of the Halifax were powered with inline Merlin engines. The Mark III was equipped with Bristol Hercules VI or XVI radial engines that, along with some other configuration changes, improved performance.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Short Stirling was one of the triad of British World War II heavy four-engine bombers. It was the first to enter service. It was also the only one of the three which, from its inception, was designed as a four-engine machine. The other two British heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and the Hadley Page Halifax [both modeled elsewhere in this collection], began in their initial design phases as two-engine machines—later being changed to four-engines. The Short Stirling was built by Short Aviation in response to a 1936 Royal Air Force specification for a new heavy bomber. The Stirling used lower technology landing flaps than the other two bombers, which used slotted flaps. This resulted in a much larger wing area and, since all three bombers were constrained to a wing span less than the 100 foot wide hanger doors, the Stirling had a much lower aspect ratio wing that resulted in a much lower service ceiling. The first Stirling flew on May 13, 1939, but crashed when its landing gear collapsed. Further testing was more positive. Its production began in early 1940 with the first machine equipping Bomber Command in August of that year. The Stirling made its first bombing raid on the night of February 10/11, 1941. Throughout its bombing career, it was used almost entirely in the night bombing role flying 18,440 missions and dropping 27,821 tons of bombs. As the other two British heavy bombers began to come into service with their better performance and higher altitude ability [the RAF rescinded its order about wing length], the Stirling was gradually withdrawn for bomber service and was used as a glider tug, where high-altitude performance was not required. The Stirling could pull two fully loaded Airspeed Horsa gliders [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and it performed with distinction in this role throughout the remainder of the war. It participated in glider attacks on D-Day at Arnhem and at the crossing of the Rhine River, among others. Another variant of the Stirling was modified as a transport and could carry troops, Jeeps, or artillery. Overall, the Stirling proved a workhorse in many roles and was a valuable machine for the British war effort.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[There are very few World War II aircraft that by themselves had a major impact upon the outcome of the conflict. The Avro Lancaster was one of those aircraft. It was one of the most successful heavy bombers of the war and the most successful British heavy bomber largely due to its bomb-carrying capacity and its versatility. Its origins began with a failure. In the late 1930s the British Air Ministry requested a new heavy bomber. The Avro Company responded with their new machine the Avro Manchester [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was a twin-engine machine of totally new design powered by two of the new Rolls-Royce Vulture engines. But it was the failure and unreliability of these new engines that doomed the Manchester. Its short and unhappy career required it to be withdrawn from all service in June 1942. From the lessons learned with the Manchester, Avro produced the Lancaster, which incorporated many of the Manchester's features—its fuselage, cockpit, center-section, tail, nose, and gun turrets. The Lancaster's outer wings were fitted to accommodate the four new Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that were to be the machine's power plants. The results were outstanding and the new heavy bomber became the heart of RAF Bomber Command with a total of over 7,300 being produced in a variety of versions or Marks [Mk]. The machine's bomb-carrying ability reached its zenith when it was modified to carry the huge Grand Slam Bomb, weighing 22,000 pounds. The B.III [Special] "Dam Buster" version, upon which this model is based, was a variant of the Lancaster specially designed to carry Barnes Wallis' 9,250-pound roller drum mine. The mine was skipped over the water into vital electricity producing dams in western Germany, thus breaching them and denying their energy to German industry. The B.III had its defensive guns removed, except the nose and tail turret, in order to carry the weight of the mines. The drum shaped mine can be seen beneath the aircraft's fuselage. Lancasters remained in RAF service for some years after the war and some sent to the French Navy served well into the 1960s. This was a truly wonderful machine.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In a desperate effort to turn the tide of its sinking fortunes during the latter years of World War II, the Luftwaffe devised a somewhat far fetched scheme to place a fighter plane on top of an older Junkers Ju 88 pilotless bomber that had been modified to hold over 8.300 pounds of high explosives within its fuselage. The pilot in the fighter would fly the composite machine to the intended target, release the Ju 88 pilotless bomber and then by radio control, direct the bomb laden Ju 88 into its target destroying it. A number of different German fighter aircraft were employed as the directing parent aircraft, but the bomber was always a modified Ju 88. The operational career of this ambitious scheme does not receive much attention in the World War II history books. It is known that the machine was employed on the Soviet front to destroy bridges in front of the advancing Soviet Army as the Germans retreated westward during the last months of the war. The effectiveness of these attacks is not well recorded. Obviously, they did not stop the Soviet invasion of the German homeland. The parent fighter aircraft of the Mistel complex modeled here is an older Messerschmitt Me 109 F. The operational Mistel bomber component had the cockpit area replaced with massive warhead]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was, without question, the most famous and the most numerous Japanese bomber of World War II. It was in front line service in every theater of Japanese operations from the first to the last day of the war. Its origins go back to 1937, with a Japanese Imperial Navy specification for a new long-range land-based bomber that could project Japanese air power into the vast reaches of the Pacific. The requirements for the new bomber were severe: a range of no less than 2,900 miles when empty, 2,200 when carrying a 1,760-pound load, and a speed of no less than 240 mph. The Mitsubishi G4M2 that was designed by Kiro Honjo, one of Mitsubishi's chief engineers, not only met but exceeded all these specifications. The first prototype took to the air on October 23, 1939, and the machine was immediately recognized as an outstanding aircraft. In fact, the new bomber had no significant faults and required only the most minimal of modifications. Inexplicably, mass production of this superb bomber was delayed and the first G4M2s [Allied code-named "Betty"] did not leave the assembly lines until April of 1941. The G4M2s scored numbers of remarkable successes during the first two years of the war, often related to their exceptional long range. Along with Mitsubishi G3M2 bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection], G4M2s took part in the sinking of the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser HMS Repulse. As the war progressed, two serious flaws became evident in these bombers: the lack of protective armor and, worse, the lack of self-sealing fuel tanks. The fires attended with Allied fighter attacks on them led the Allied fighter pilots to call the G4M2s "Flying Cigars." It was in a G4M2 that American P 38 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] ambushed, shot down, and killed Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Over their entire production run 2,445 machines were built. The final role of this famous bomber was on August 19, 1945, when it carried the Japanese delegation to the official World War II surrender ceremonies.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This huge machine was the oldest bomber in active service when World War II began in September of 1939. It was also, without question, the most bizarre in appearance. It stood on a huge fixed tubular four-wheeled undercarriage. It stood as high as a three-story building. It had an open cockpit for its pilots and open mounts for its defensive machine gunners. Its entire construction was of metal framing covered with a corrugated metal skin. Four liquid-cooled inline piston engines drove four impressive 11 foot 9 inch diameter, fixed pitch, two-bladed, wooden propellers. It was a true giant looking as if it was from another age. The TB-3 was designed by the father of the Tupolev Design Bureau, Andrei Nikolaevich Tupolev, in the 1920s. It entered service with the Red Air Force in 1931 and was the principle Soviet heavy bomber throughout the 1930s. It was still equipping several Soviet bombing regiments when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941. It carried its entire bomb load externally beneath its fuselage. Although obsolete and helpless when confronted by modern German fighters, the machine remained flying until 1944. It had been largely relegated to secondary duties as a transport and paratrooper platform during the last two years of its service. In this latter role, its method of deployment was as bizarre as was the aircraft's appearance. The paratroopers would literally cling in several rows to the top of the TB-3's broad wings as it flew through the air, dropping off the trailing edge of the wings when the machine reached its designated drop zone. As ancient and out of date these machines may have been, production at the Tupolev Bureau did not end until exactly 800 had been produced.]]>

<![CDATA[Germany's large bomber force at the beginning of the war and with which it largely fought was devoid of a heavy bomber. The distances in Europe and the German military plan of conquest based on "Blitzkrieg," led Hitler and his German planners to remain wed to two-engine medium bombers. The only attempt to build a four-engine heavy bomber was in the construction of the Heinkel He 117 Greif [modeled here]. German aeronautical engineering and design was among the best in the world before and during World War II, and it is difficult to understand how all that expertise could have gone so wrong in the creation of the He 117. Instead of the four-propeller format of all other World War II heavy bombers, the Germans used just two huge propellers of 15 feet in diameter. To power such large airscrews, greater power was required than was available in any existing German engine. The solution was to combine two engines driving the single propeller. The radiator for the two engines was radial in configuration and was placed in front of the engine duo just behind the massive propeller. The proximity of the two powerful engines caused heat build up that could never be resolved by the German engineers. So frequent were the fires that erupted during the machine's operation that Luftwaffe crews came to nickname the He 117 the "Luftwaffenfeuerzeug" ["Luftwaffe Lighter"]. The problem was so severe that of over 1,000 He 117s built only a few hundred went into combat. All were withdrawn in late 1944 and early 1945. During their operational career, they were often deployed in anti-shipping roles employing the new FX 1400 Fritz air-to-surface radio controlled anti-ship missile. Two of these can be seen under the wings of this model. Over its troubled career, the He 117 was also used in a variety of other roles—roles for that it was never intended, including its use as a transport attempting to supply the beleaguered German troops during the Battle of Stalingrad. Overall, the He 117 was a failure and never achieved its mission as a strategic heavy bomber, essentially denying the Luftwaffe of such a vital tool during the entirety of World War II.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[If there was one aircraft that came to symbolize the American war effort against Nazi Germany, it has to be the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. The machine played an enormous role in the annihilation of the Third Reich and in bringing about victory in the European war. The B-17 project began at the Boeing Company in the summer of 1934 in response to a specification from the United States Army for a large multi-engine bomber capable of carrying a heavy bomb load over a long distance. Boeing engineers selected four engines for their new machine at a time when most contemporary bombers were powered by just two. They designed the machine with a circular-section fuselage, partially retracting landing gear, and a low wing configuration. The first prototype flew on July 28, 1935. Alterations were made in the original prototype and in several subsequent prototypes. The first U.S. Army Air Force order placed for the B-17 was for the B version in 1938. Boeing continued to improve the machine bringing out C and D versions, the first to see combat in World War II both in British and U.S. service. The E version was radically different, with the addition of many more defensive guns; prompting the name "Flying Fortress." The final G version [modeled here] was produced in the greatest numbers and was provided with a "chin" turret beneath its nose. The B-17 was liked by its crews not only for its performance but also for the machine's ability to tolerate severe combat damage and still be able to return to its base. The B-17 is in that small group of warplanes that had a great impact on the war's outcome.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Liberator bomber never achieved the fame of its contemporary the B-17 Flying Fortress, but it was built in greater numbers than any other bomber or, indeed, any other American military aircraft of World War II. Including all 15 different versions, some 18,188 machines were constructed compared to other Allied heavy bombers [12,731 B-17s and only 7,366 British Lancasters𠅋oth modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Versatility was one of the greatest assets of the B-24, secondary only to its very long range. Liberators closed the gap in the Atlantic Ocean, where German submarines were once immune to air attack from Allied aircraft. Not so after the appearance of the Liberator. Consolidated began the B-24 project in January 1939 in response to a specification from the United States Army Air Force for a new four-engine bomber with long range, the ability to carry a heavy bomb load, and with performance superior to the B-17, the main heavy bomber of the United States at that time. The B-24 had a long slender wing around which the aircraft was designed—a wing that contained vast fuel tanks imparting to the B-24 the long range for which it became famous. It had unique roller-type sliding bomb bay doors that greatly reduced drag. The new bomber made its maiden flight on December 29, 1939, and immediately was put into mass production not only by Consolidated Aircraft but, in view of the demand for the superb machine, several other American companies. While it served in many roles [maritime reconnaissance bomber, transport, and trainer] its main contribution to the war effort came as a heavy bomber. While the machine was involved in all the theaters of operation during the war, its bombing raids on German industry were epic and contributed to the German defeat. The B-24 was not only used by the United States but also by Great Britain, Australia, and the other Allies.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Kurt Tank, technical director and chief engineer of Focke-Wulf, designed the Fw 200 as a civilian long-range transport capable of flying the Atlantic with a crew of 4 and 26 passengers. Aerodynamically, the machine was outstanding with all-metal stressed skin construction and flush riveting but its control surfaces were fabric-covered. Kurt Tank himself made the first successful maiden flight of the new Fw 200 on August 10, 1938. A Fw 200 set a record when it flew non-stop against prevailing winds from Berlin-Tempelhof to Floyd Bennett field in New York, a distance of 4,075 miles, in 24 hours and 55 minutes. The return trip was flown in 19 hours and 47 minutes. The Luftwaffe's initial lack of interest in the Fw 200 changed as war appeared to be eminent. In 1939, Fw 200s were taken into the military as "C" variants. They were fitted with extra fuel tanks, guns, bombs, flares, and other equipment for their use as maritime reconnaissance bombers designed to seek out and attack British shipping in the Atlantic. The transition was difficult because the Fw 200 was not designed as a military aircraft and was never meant to fly from rough air fields and to carry the extra weight of military equipment. Nonetheless, Fw 200s were placed in service as the war began and in its early months Condors sank 90,000 tons of British shipping. By February 1941, it had reached 363,000 tons leading Winston Churchill to call the Fw 200 "The Scourge of the Atlantic." Only a total of 252 of all Fw 200 variants were built and, in view of their many roles and assignments, they were simply never enough to make a serious impact on Allied shippingrtainly nothing like the toll taken by German U-boats. But overall, the Fw 200 gave good performance for a civilian aircraft that was forced into a military role for that it was not designed.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The B-29 could be regarded as the most important aircraft in history; the aircraft that brought to an end to the world's greatest war. The machine modeled here, "Bockscar," dropped the atomic bomb named "Fat Man" on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. A model of "Fat Man" rests beside this model of "Bockscar." A sister machine of the same unit, the "Enola Gay," dropped the atomic bomb "Little Boy" on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, three days before. These actions essentially forced the unconditional surrender of Japan, thus bringing to a close the worst conflict in human history. The B-29's history dates back to January 1940, when the United States Army Air Force issued a specification for a new super heavy bomber. Of the companies submitting proposals, Boeing won the contract and production began. Over the career of this huge machine, a total of 3,597 were constructed. The B-29 was one of the most complicated aircraft of World War II and occupied the American aeronautical industry in the largest and most difficult project of the war. Dozens of companies were involved in the creation and building of B-29 components. Final assembly of the machines was carried out at four huge plants—Boeing at Wichita, Kansas, and Renton, Washington, Martin at Omaha, Nebraska, and Bell at Marietta, Georgia. The aircraft was completely new. It was a long middle-wing monoplane with a tricycle landing gear, a circular-section fuselage, and a totally pressurized interior cabin [except the bomb bay]. The new aircraft made its maiden flight on September 21, 1942, but, as could be expected with a machine of its size and complexity, no fewer than 9,900 faults had to be eliminated before the B-29 was ready for operational use. The decision was made to employ the machine in the Pacific theater where its long range and huge bomb carrying capacity could be used to greatest advantage. The B-29's first combat mission was the bombing of Bangkok on June 5, 1944. Its first bombing raid on Japan was just 10 days latter, striking the large steel works at Kyūshū. Over the weeks that followed, tons of bombs were dropped on the cities of Japan raining destruction on its industrial base. There were three variants; the B-29, the B-29A, and the B-29B. Two B-29Bs [modeled here] were field modified to carry the atomic bombs. The B differed from the A in that all of its defensive armament was removed [except for its tail turret]. The following data is for the standard B-29B.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Many aviation historians regard this aircraft as the best Japanese bomber of World War II. The Japanese classified it as a heavy bomber, but by the standards of other nations it was a medium bomber. The Mitsubishi Ki-67 was built in response to a February of 1941 Japanese specification for a new bomber with high performance, great speed, and an increased bomb load. The first prototype flew in December of 1942 and was immediately recognized as an excellent machine. The mass production that followed saw the Ki-67 in a variety of versions: bomber, dive-bomber, torpedo bomber, night fighter, and reconnaissance bomber. The Ki-67's first combat was at the violent air-sea battles off Formosa in October of 1944, when it was deployed in an anti-shipping role. One variant of the Ki-67 had a 75 mm cannon installed in its nose for combating the high flying American B 29s [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The machine's performance was superior in all of its many roles. The only problem with the aircraft was that it arrived on the scene very late in the war and in insufficient numbers to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of the conflict. Only 698 were produced before the Japanese surrender.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[As the war progressed, German engineers were constantly attempting to develop the ultimate "secret weapon." The V-1 "Buzz Bomb" and the V-2 rocket [V for Vergeltungswaffe, meaning "retaliatory weapon"] were attempts in this direction. The Fi 103 V-1 was developed beginning in June of 1942 at a research facility in Peenemünde. The missile was powered by a pulse jet engine that created a loud sputtering sound, from which the machine derived its nickname—"Buzz Bomb." It was manufactured using readily available non-strategic materials—wood and cheap iron. Its guidance was pre-set and the missile fell from the sky when its supply of pre-measured fuel was expended. Targeting was impossible and the machine was directed into an area no more precise than an 8-mile diameter circle. This meant that it was directed at large population centers, like greater London, as a weapon of terror. Launching took place on a 150-foot long ramp using a piston method of acceleration. Launch speed was about 200 mph. Mass production of these machines began in March of 1944 and about 35,000 were produced before the war ended. Over 9,000 of these were fired against England. The Fi 103 V-1 was the beginning of today's modern cruise missiles. A manned version was under development 1944, but was cancelled after initial testing.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The A-4 [V-2] was the world's first operational ballistic missile. As such, it revolutionized and changed forever the concepts of strategic warfare. Its development began in 1937, but it was not until October 1942 that the first successful test flights were completed. Production began at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast but, due to multiple engineering problems centered around its rocket propulsion, operational use was delayed until September 1944. With a trajectory of 60 miles above Earth and a reentry speed of 3,500 mph there was no possible chance of interception or defense against the missile once it was airborne. Since it could be launched from a platform that was moveable from place to place, destruction of its launch sites was equally impossible. The weapon lacked the ability to accurately hit a specific target. A general area could be targeted but a defined location within that area was not possible. Some 10,000 A-4s were produced before the war's end. Of these, about 5,500 were fired against Allied targets—1,359 against England, primarily London. The British sustained over 2,500 deaths and over 6,000 injuries as a result of A-4s. The destruction caused by A-4s was only stopped with Germany capitulation. At the war's end, the A-4 scientists, including Werner von Braun, the program's chief engineer, were brought to the United States where their work became the basis for America's intercontinental ballistic missile and space programs.]]>

It saw extensive action in the early months of World War II in the Mediterranean, where it equipped eight units of the Aéronavale [the French Naval Air Arm]. After the capitulation of France in June of 1940, one unit of the Aéronavale that was flying Latécoère 298s escaped with their machines to England where they joined British Coastal Command performing anti-submarine patrols throughout the remainder of the war.

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed in 1933 in response to a Japanese Imperial Navy specification for a new reconnaissance machine that would be deployed aboard Japanese battleships and cruisers. Such reconnaissance aircraft of the 1930s were much alike in their configuration. They were almost uniformly biplanes. Indeed, the biplane proved invaluable in the role of catapult launched machines serving on the capital ships. All World War II combatant nations with capital ships employed the biplane format because in many cases the biplane was superior to monoplane types. Biplanes continued on throughout the entire war as the "eyes" of the large naval warships. The prototype of this E8N2 [Allied code-named "Dave"] was deployed aboard the Japanese battleship Haruna, which was a part of the large Japanese task force embarked to invade the United States Island of Midway in June of 1942. In one of the most decisive naval battles of all time, American carrier-based aircraft destroyed the four Japanese aircraft carriers of the task force. Without air cover, the Japanese were forced to retire from the battle. The Battle of Midway, that occurred just 6 months after the Pearl Harbor attack, was a turning point of the Pacific war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Mitsubishi Ki-21 was the most widely used Japanese Army heavy bomber of World War II and was something of the counterpart to the Mitsubishi G4M "Betty" [modeled elsewhere in this collection] that was used by the Japanese Imperial Navy. The Army called the Ki-21 a heavy bomber but by the standards of other air forces of the era, it was a medium bomber. The project began with a specification issued by the Army in February of 1936 for a new bomber with rather advanced requirements for the time, including good speed and long range. Like with so many other Japanese World War II military aircraft, the quest for speed and range could only be achieved with the sacrifice of armor protection, defensive fire power, and loss of bomb payload. The first Ki-21 prototype flew on December 18, 1936, and the initial production machines were delivered almost a year later. The Ki-21 [Allied code-named "Sally"] were used in the Sino-Japanese war, where operational experience led to the development of additional variants including the Ki-21 IIa [modeled here]. The newer variants had more powerful engines and improved defensive armament, although their bomb load was not greatly increased. Ki-21s were in front line service with the Japanese Army when Japan entered World War II and remained in that service until the final day of the war. Including all of its five variants, 2,064 were produced from March 1938 until September 1944. The Ki-21 was a workhorse, if not an exceptional bomber.]]>

<![CDATA[The LaGG-family of Soviet fighters is named after the Soviet aircraft designers S.A. Lavochkin, V.P. Gorbunov and M.I. Goudkov. Work on the LaGG-3 aircraft began in 1938, but the new fighter did not make its maiden flight until March 30, 1940. The machine was a monoplane of sleek aerodynamic design, unusual because it was built entirely of plywood, a material that the Soviet Union had in great abundance. Its initial test flights revealed many defects and faults requiring multiple modifications. With these corrections, the aircraft went into production as the LaGG-3, with the first machines entering operational service in 1941 shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The LaGG-3 was widely used during the early months of the war with Germany, but it never displayed the essentials of a fine fighter—the role for that it had been designed. An inadequate power plant plagued the LaGG-3 and was largely responsible for the machine's limited success as a fighter. It achieved greater success as a ground attack and reconnaissance aircraft. Despite the machines faults and marginal performance, a total of 6,528 came off the assembly lines before production was terminated in August of 1942 in favor of the LaGG-5 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the LaGG-3's successor.]]>

<![CDATA[The Gotha Go 244 was directly derived from the Gotha Go 242 glider. The entire rear of the Go 242 glider's fuselage could open upward, giving ready and easy assess to the machine's box shaped roomy cabin. The success of the glider inspired the Luftwaffe designers to place engines on the previous powerless gliders to create an attack transport to be used in the rapid envelopment concept of "Blitzkrieg." The project was further enabled by the abundance of French Gnome-Rhône 14M radial engines that became available after the fall of France. Thus, Go 242 glider airframes were wed to two Gnome-Rhône engines. The resultant machine was very underpowered and could not fly on a single engine even unloaded—a serious fault in any combat aircraft. Furthermore, the Go 244 was slow and an easy target for enemy fighters. Including all models, 174 Gotha Go 244s were built. Gotha Go 244s were deployed in campaigns in Greece and Crete. Combat performance was very unsatisfactory and the aircraft were subsequently relegated to paratrooper training schools or were scraped.]]>

</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[The Blackburn Aircraft Corporation designed and built the Botha in response to a 1935 Air Ministry specification for a new twin-engine reconnaissance bomber. The machine had problems from the beginning. Blackburn had wanted to use 1,130 hp Bristol Taurus radial engines for their new machine, but these were in such short supply that Blackburn was forced to use 880 hp Bristol Perseus radials instead. They proved inadequate and lack of proper power plagued the Botha throughout its entire career. Nonetheless, orders for 442 machines were placed in 1936 and the first production aircraft flew in December of 1938. The machine began equipping Royal Air Force units a year later. Trouble soon arose. A number of unexplained crashes occurred causing criticism that the Botha was underpowered. Upgraded, more powerful 930 hp Bristol Perseus engines replaced the old power plants, but fatal crashes continued until the aircraft was finally withdrawn from service in September of 1944. Probably the safest role the machine played during the war was when numbers of Botha fuselages were sent to the RAF School of Technical Training for use in the training of ground crew repairmen. Under the pressures of war and the urgent need for aircraft, it was used as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft and occasionally used as a torpedo bomber. Its career was not distinguished and it took the lives of many good British airmen.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Mitsubishi built this aircraft in response to a specification issued by the Japanese Imperial Navy in the mid 1930s for a new reconnaissance catapult-launched seaplane that would be carried aboard Japanese battleships and cruisers. Following test flights and several revisions, the production F1M2s [Allied code-named "Pete"] entered service in the spring of 1941. While primarily used as shipboard reconnaissance machines, the role for that they were designed, they also served in other roles: fighters, dive-bombers, and close support aircraft. The F1M2 modeled here had a profound indirect impact on the history of World War II. It was one of two F1M2 reconnaissance aircraft carried aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser Tone that was a member of the task force planning to invade the United States' island of Midway in June of 1942. It, along with numerous other reconnaissance aircraft from the battleships and cruisers of the task force, was ordered to search for American aircraft carriers that were suspected of being in the area. Mechanical troubles delayed the takeoff of this F1M2 for over one hour. It was in this aircraft's sector of search that the three American carriers were located. The F1M2 discovered the carriers but the delay allowed the American Douglas SBD dive bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection] to successfully attack and sink three Japanese aircraft carriers on the first day of the battle. The same American SBDs sunk the fourth and last Japanese aircraft carrier the following day. Without any air cover, the Japanese task force had no alternative but to retire without invading Midway. This epic sea battle, one of the most decisive in naval history, totally changed the momentum of World War II in the Pacific and put the heretofore invincible Japanese on the defensive for the remainder of the war.]]>

<![CDATA[The Beechcraft Airplane Manufacturing Company based in Wichita, Kansas, first flew its Model 18, a light utility passenger transport, in January of 1937. This began a long line of machines of similar design. The United States Army Air Force became interested in these aircraft not only as utility transports, but also for use in a variety of training roles and placed its first order for aircraft in the summer of 1940. Over the months leading up to World War II, as the Army Air Force dramatically expanded, it ordered hundreds more of these machines in various different versions, mainly for the training of pilots, navigators, gunners and radio operators. The AT [Advanced Trainer] 11 modeled here was procured as a bombing trainer. It incorporated a small bomb bay, circular porthole windows, and a redesigned nose to provide a bomb-aiming position. Production of the AT-11 for the Army Air Force totaled 1,582 units over the duration of the war. Almost all AT-11s served within the continental United States and did not have camouflage paint schemes.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft is another in the line of machines manufactured by the Letov Company of Prague during the 1930s. The first member of family was the Letov Š.31, followed by the Š.131, Š.231, Š.331, and Š.431. All of the aircraft had metal tubular framing and fabric covering with a metal engine cowling. The Š.331 was a single prototype. While the Š.31, Š.131, Š.231, and Š.431 had engines of 480 to 680 hp, the Š.331 had a Walter K14 engine with 900 hp. This powerful engine gave it extremely high speed and outstanding performance for an aircraft of the early 1930s. In May 1935, the aircraft established a new Czechoslovak altitude record of 34,941 feet (10,650 m). The sole Š.331 and almost all of the Š.231s were sold to representatives of the Spanish Republican government. The Š.231s fared poorly in the Spanish Civil War. The operational performance and ultimate fate of the Š.331 is unrecorded.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Celestino Rosatelli, chief engineer at Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico, designed the Fiat BR 20 in 1936. It was a twin-engine machine, which was unusual given the Italian preference for three engine bombers. It was a low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction and was technically advanced and modern when it entered service with the Regia Aeronautica in 1937. BR 20s saw service on the side of the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War where their performance was considered good. The aircraft modeled is a BR.20. By the time of Italy's entry into World War II in June of 1940, the original design had been updated to the BR.20/M with a revised nose configuration, and increased armor. Performance suffered with the increased weight. The aircraft took part in the brief war with France and supported the Luftwaffe in the later stages of the Battle of Britain. Most of the BR.20/M combat missions were in North Africa in the support of Italian ground forces. A few BR.20/M aircraft were involved in Italian campaigns in Greece and the Balkans. The BR.20/M was the most common version of the aircraft with a production run of 264 aircraft. Fiat developed several upgraded versions of the Br.20 ending with the BR.20bis. The BR.20bis was a complete redesign with major improvements in armament and engine power. The 1,250 hp Fiat A.82 RC42 engines gave the aircraft increased speed, payload, and a higher service ceiling. Only 15 aircraft of the final design were built prior to the surrender of Italy and there is no record of their operational use. The data below is for a BR.20/M.]]>

For safety when flying long distances over the ocean, the new machine was given two engines. In responding to the specification, Kyūshū Hikōki created an aircraft that had a very strong resemblance to the German Junkers Ju 88 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The crew were all seated in a highly glazed compartment in the nose of the fuselage. The aircraft was equipped with the new Japanese type 3 search radar and with magnetic anomaly detection gear. The Q1W1 Model 11 [Allied code-named "Lorna"] began flying missions in late 1944 by that time Japan had essentially lost the war. Japanese records are unclear as to just how effective these aircraft were in detecting and destroying American submarines. A total of 153 of these aircraft were built between April of 1943 when the first prototype flew and August of 1945 when World War II ended.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was a product of the Mitsubishi Company's late 1930s entry into the civilian airplane market. A new L3M1 [like the one modeled here] attracted world aviation attention when in 1939 it covered 32,820 miles in just 194 hours of flying time—a record up to that date. The companion aircraft to the L3M1 [Allied code-named "Tina"] was its military version, the G3M2 [Allied coded-name "Nell," modeled elsewhere in this collection]. With the Japanese entry into World War II, the Japanese government requisitioned the L3M1 transports, which had been built for the civilian market. They were placed into military service as passenger transports for senior officers and civilian officials, a role they fulfilled throughout the entire war. A few of the surviving machines reverted to civilian use after the war. By 1943, the G3M2 "Nell" bombers were becoming obsolete. The First Naval Air Arsenal at Kasumigaura converted a number of G3M1s and G3M2s bombers to L3Y1s and L3Y2s armed transports. These aircraft incorporated cabin windows and a passenger doors. Like the L3M1 discussed above, these aircraft were given the Allied codename "Tina."]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Gauntlet was designed and produced to fulfill a specification issued in October 1931 by the British Air Ministry for a new fighter. Seven companies entered the competition and Gloster finally emerged as the winner and was given a production contract in July 1935. The early production Gauntlet—a biplane with an open cockpit and two-blade wooden prop—almost seemed like a holdover from WWI. The first production aircraft began equipping fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force in 1937. The machine remained active with RAF fighter units until the late 1930s, when they were replaced by aircraft that were more modern. In the early weeks of World War II, a few of the old Gauntlets were still in active service with RAF units in the Middle East. Gauntlets were also purchased by Denmark, Rhodesia, and Finland. The latter nation acquired 25 of these biplane fighters. Their Gauntlets were still flying with Finnish fighter units when Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union early in World War II. The machines were obsolete, yet they continued to fly against the Soviet Air Force. As the Finnish-Soviet conflict progressed, most of the Gauntlets were relegated to training duties as they were replaced by more modern fighters.]]>

A total of 202 CANT Z.501s were in active service when Italy entered WWII as a German ally. These flying boats were initially used by Italian Naval Reconnaissance squadrons in the Mediterranean, where they played active roles not only in reconnaissance but also in anti-submarine warfare, air-sea rescue, and convoy escort. Combat operations showed that the aircraft lacked the performance and defensive firepower needed to operate in areas with active fighter opposition. The CANT Z.501 primary missions in the later part of the war were as a search and rescue or coastal patrol aircraft.]]>

<comments><![CDATA[Model Builder's Comments: During the 1930s in the years leading up to Italy's entry into World War II and continuing into the early months of the war, many Italian military aircraft had very colorful, often gaudy, paint schemes. Some sported bright red and silver wings, as did the CANT Z.501 modeled here. As the war progressed and Allied fighter aircraft became more common in the Mediterranean theater, a policy of camouflage was instituted by the Regia Aeronautica [the Italian Air Force]. How much good wartime camouflage of aircraft actually achieved is not clear, but it was almost universally employed by all combatant nations except the United States, which in the later years of the war left many of their aircraft unpainted in raw polished aluminum.]]></comments>

<![CDATA[The Model 18, a light twin-engine transport and utility aircraft produced by the Beechcraft Company of Wichita, Kansas, was the prototype of this model. Named the "Expeditor," the United States Army Air Force designated the aircraft the C-45 while the Navy and Marine Corps called the identical machine the JRB-2. In the expansion leading up to and during World War II, over 1,400 Expeditors were manufactured for the military. They were employed not only by the U.S. air services but also by Great Britain and other Allied nations. The appearance, configuration, and construction of the Expeditor is very similar to another Beech aircraft—the AT-11 Kansan [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. While AT-11s were used mainly as trainers, Expeditors maintained an almost uniform role as light personnel transports. They remained in active military service around the world, including in the United States, until well into the 1960s.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was very unique. It was the only fighter designed and built during World War II that was driven by not one, but by two separate tandem arranged engines turning counter-rotating propellers. The two Kawasaki Ha 40 engines were installed in the fuselage, one in the nose and one behind the pilot. The combination was known as the Ha-201. This unusual arrangement was combined with a steam vapor cooling system over the surfaces of the machine's wings rather than the usual radiator employed by most liquid-cooled engines. The first Ki-64 [Allied code-named "Rob"] flew in November of 1943, but over-heating of the rear engine presented a problem. A serious fire developed during the aircraft's fifth test flight. Engine problems continued to plague the machine's new revolutionary power plant and cooling system. These difficulties combined with the collapsing conditions within Japan in 1945 resulted in the cancellation of the Ki-64 program after only a few prototypes had been manufactured. None reached active operational units and none saw actual combat.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This three-engine aircraft was designed and produced by the Italian aviation company Savoia-Marchetti as a civilian transport with the capability of being transformed in to a military bomber. It first flew in its civilian form on June 4, 1934 and was promptly purchased by the Regia Aeronautica and given the name "Pipistrello" ["Bat"]. The SM.81 became the initial aircraft in a series of Marchetti three-engine bombers that were to serve the Regia Aeronautica during World War II. Two other Savoia-Marchetti bombers are modeled in this collection. Three sub-variants of the SM.81 were built within the total of 534 produced. They all looked alike externally, differing only in their power plants. The MS 81's combat career began prior to World War II during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the Ethiopian campaigns. Nationalist forces supporting General Franco used the aircraft in the Spanish Civil War. By the time of Italy's entry into World War II in June of 1940, the SM.81 was obsolete and an easy target for Allied fighters. A slow aircraft with fixed landing gear, it was used mainly as a transport although it did undertake some night bombing raids on Allied positions in North Africa. It served throughout the entire war. After the Italian capitulation to the Allies in September of 1943, numbers of SM.81s entered service with the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force and flew with the Allies. The Germans seized some SM.81s and used them as transports for the Luftwaffe during the final months of the war. A small number of SM.81s survived the war and served the Regia Aeronautica until 1950.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Junkers in 1926. It was a light transport that functioned mainly as a passenger liner. Due to restrictions placed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, Germany was forbidden to manufacture anything but civilian transport aircraft. The W 34 was such a machine. Its construction conformed to the Junkers style of aircraft𠅊ll-metal with a corrugated stressed skin of duralumin. The machine was built in large numbers and achieved some success in the infantile civilian airline industry of the time. While the W 34 had a closed cockpit, the virtually identical W 33 had an open cockpit. Both aircraft flew with a variety of engines and operated as landplanes or seaplanes. The W 34 is best remembered as the predecessor of the famous Junkers Ju 52 transport [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which was one of the best transports of World War II and the backbone of the Luftwaffe's transport service. By the outbreak of World War II, the W 34 had been largely replaced by the larger and newer Ju 52. A few W 34s remained flying as the aircraft for senior officers. The W 34 prototype of this model has just landed at Tempelhof airdrome, Berlin's main airport, and a senior officer of the German Army is stepping off the aircraft and is being greeted by a reception committee seated in a Mercedes Benz G4/W31 staff car.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The initial B.534 was designed by Frantisek Novotny, chief engineer of the Czech firm Avia in 1932. The first prototype flew the following year. The version IV modeled here was the final and definitive machine of the B.534 series. It was of all-metal construction with mixed metal and wood covering. The aircraft had excellent flight characteristics and speed for a biplane. During the 1937 International Aeronautical Rally in Zürich, in all the main competitions, the B.534 came in second to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The B.534 was the main fighter of the Czech Air Force from 1935 until well into World War II. Approximately 450 Avia B.534 aircraft were built. Following German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939, Germany sent many of these aircraft to the newly created Slovakian Air Force. B.534s were also sent to the Bulgarian Air Force and still others were taken over by the Luftwaffe for training duties. Slovakia, a member of the Axis Power—although probably a reluctant one—sent Avia B.534 IV fighter aircraft to the Soviet Front to assist their German allies. These B.534 IV aircraft, although obsolete by most standards, gave a reasonable account of themselves against Soviet aircraft, many of which were little more modern than the Slovakian B.534s. This model replicates a Slovakian B.534 IV aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Letov company of Prague was the principle aircraft manufacturer in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. The firm designed several different aircraft both for the Czech Air Force and for export. Letov designed two series of two-seat observation and light bomber biplanes based on the Š.16 and the Š.28. Both of these designs had a quickly detachable engine mounting permitting the installation of any engine of similar power or type. For example, there were nine versions of the Š.16, each with a different engine and a unique type designation. The Š.16 derivatives included "16" as part of the type number resulting in Š.116, Š.216, Š.316, Š.416, Š.516, Š.616, Š.716, Š.816, and Š.916.The Letov Š.428 [modeled here] was designed as a close ground support aircraft covering armies on the battlefield. The engine was an Avia VR-36 545 kW, V-12 liquid-cooled inline piston engine of 740 hp. Like the Š.128, Š.228, Š.328, and Š.538, the Š.428 was a development of the Š.28. The Š.328 was the most common of the Š.28 versions and entered operational service in 1934. Its performance was considered good and it was used not only as a ground support machine but also what the Czech Air Force subsequently came to describe as a "heavy fighter." By the time of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939, the Letov Š.328 was hopelessly obsolete and could not survive against modern monoplane fighters in either of its intended roles. Nonetheless, the machine remained in front line service with the Czech Air Force throughout the 1930s and even after the German occupation. The records of Czech aviation during World War II are meager, so little is known about the operational history of the Letov Š.328 aside from the fact it remained on the Czech roster of aircraft well into the war. Some of these aircraft were handed over to Germany's allies Bulgaria and Slovakia but nothing is known of their activity in those hands. None is known to have survived the war. The following data is for the Š.328.]]>

<![CDATA[Italian aircraft designers preferred a three-engine design for medium-sized aircraft. The CANT Z.1007 was of such a persuasion. This machine, along with the SM.79, the SM.81 and the Br.20 [all modeled elsewhere in this collection], constituted the Regia Aeronautica's land-based bomber force during World War II. Filippo Zappata designed the CANT Z.1007 in 1935. Its airframe was made entirely of wood, which proved to be somewhat problematic in the harsh climates of the deserts of North Africa and the winters of the Soviet Union. Manufactured in three basic variants, it was a satisfactory aircraft that gave good performance in the roles of bomber, torpedo bomber, and reconnaissance aircraft. Although a few deployed to the Soviet Union in support of Italy's ally Germany, the majority of the Alcione's activities were in the Greek campaign and in the Mediterranean theater. Five hundred sixty aircraft of all variants were manufactured between 1939 and 1943. Early production CANT Z.1007 bis aircraft were produced with a single rudder as shown on the model displayed. Midway through the production run, the design was changed to have twin rudders. At the time of the Italian armistice in September of 1943, thirty of these aircraft were seized by the Germans and were taken into Northern Italy to serve under German control𠅊lthough none saw combat in this role. About the same number became part of the Italian cobelligerent forces and fought along side the Allies in the Balkans.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Marcel Bloch Company designed the MB.200 in 1933. After winning a design competition, Bloch licensed the Potez, Loire, and Bréguet Companies to build 208 MB.200s for France. Lacking experience in the development and construction of large all-metal bomber aircraft, the Czechoslovakian government contracted with France [which at the time was also not very far advanced in the building of modern bombers] to build, under license, the all-metal MB.200. The first Czech-built aircraft manufactured under this arrangement by the Aero Factory in Prague was delivered in 1937. The primary difference between the French and the Czech MB.200s was the engine. The French installed two 870 hp Gnome-Rhône engines while the Czechs installed two 750 hp Walter K-14-I radial engines. When first designed in 1935, the MB.200 was a relatively modern machine but by the start of World War II all the French aircraft had been scrapped or reassigned to training units. By time of its arrival in the Czech Air Force, advances in bomber design had left the MB.200 obsolete. Yet, one hundred twenty-four aircraft were built by the Czechs and remained in service. After Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Germans, the MB.200s were taken over for limited use by the Luftwaffe as transports and for utility services. None of the Aero-built aircraft were used as bombers. The Germans did transfer some MB.200s to the Air Forces of Bulgaria and Rumania where they saw very limited service. Overall, these bombers were out of date by the beginning of WWII. The aircraft were typical of the square-box shaped bomber designs developed by the French in the 1930s—machines that were out classed and that gave very poor performance during the conflict. A major defect of the MB.200 was that it was underpowered and unable to fly on only one engine—a serious shortcoming in a combat bomber. While the Czechs termed this machine a heavy bomber, it was not capable of carrying a bomb load common to most WWII medium or even light bombers. The following data is for the French-built MB.200s.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was probably the finest fighter Japan put in the air during World War II. It was derived from the Kawanishi N1K1 Kyōfū seaplane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The N1K1 was so successful and had such excellent performance that Kawanishi engineers felt they should design a land-based version of the seaplane. The result was the N1K2 [Allied code-named "George"]. This new machine had it all. Great speed, great armament, and great maneuverability. The only shortcoming was the power plant that gave periodic trouble throughout the entire career of the fighter. Yet, the machine, when functioning properly, was equal to any of the contemporary Allied fighters. The total production of the N1K2 in all its different variants was 1,440 machines, but their arrival was late in the war—not until mid 1944 by that time Japan had lost all hope of any victory. Numbers of these fine fighters ended their careers in very inglorious ways as Kamikaze suicide bombers during the final days of the Pacific war.]]>

</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was built in response to a 1937 Japanese Army specification for a new ground attack machine to replace the Ki-30 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The specification was ambitious. It called for an aircraft that would be highly maneuverable, have protection for its crew, a speed of no less than 260 mph, be able to carry a bomb load of no less than 440 pounds, and to be able to fly from rough landing areas near combat zones—a tall order for the day. The Mitsubishi design team not only met but exceeded these demands. The first prototype of the Ki-51 [Allied code-named "Sonia"] flew in the summer of 1939. The all-metal monoplane had a fixed faired landing gear and was immediately recognized as a superior machine. It entered production in early 1940. The Ki-51 first saw combat in China, where its performance was outstanding in an atmosphere where there were few or no enemy fighters. The Ki-51 was involved in almost all theaters of action during the Pacific war, equipping almost all Japanese ground-attack units. When the machine was confronted with modern Allied fighters during the later years of the war, it became vulnerable. Nonetheless, it continued on in constant combat up until the very end of the war. The aircraft's chief assets were its reliability, ruggedness, ability to fly from marginal airstrips, ease of maintenance and, perhaps most importantly, its availability. Over 2,300 Ki-51s were manufactured between 1940 and July of 1945. The Ki-51 was a true workhorse and the Japanese found it impossible to replace it in the tactical role of ground support.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Yokosuka D4Y2 [modeled here] was one of only two World War II Japanese combat aircraft that were fitted with liquid-cooled engines. The remainder of Japanese warplanes had radial air-cooled engines. The D4Y2's career was attended with endless troubles with its power plant, which greatly hampered its effectiveness. The design of the D4Y2 began in 1938 and was greatly influenced by the German Daimler Benz DB 601 A inline engine. However, this German engine was not available to the Japanese, who substituted it for the Daimler Benz DB 600, which gave the new aircraft insufficient power. Nonetheless, it had its maiden flight in December of 1940. There were other problems. Although the D4Ys [Allied code-named "Judy"] had excellent aerodynamic properties, they proved to have serious structural weakness when subjected to the stress and strains of dive bombing. These faults were slow in resolution and it was not until March of 1943 that the first D4Y2s began to equip operational units of the Imperial Japanese Navy. By this time, the German power plants had been replaced by Japanese liquid-cooled engines, which proved to be little better than the German engines. Although 2,038 were produced, the machine was not successful as a dive bomber and continued to be plagued with engine problems. Due to their inadequate defensive armament and poor performance, the D4Y2s were badly mauled by American carrier-based fighters at air battles during the American invasion of the Mariana Islands. The machines ended their undistinguished careers as suicide Kamikaze bombers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Japanese Imperial navy issued a specification in late 1939 for a more modern and powerful torpedo bomber to replace the Nakajima B5N2 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The project was under the direction of Kenichi Matsamura, who basically took the airframe of the highly successful B5N2 and added a more powerful engine and several other modifications. The new B6N1 [Allied code-named "Jill"] first flew in the spring of 1941. Its test flights revealed significant stability problems and an undercarriage weakness when landing on carrier decks. Modifications to correct these faults delayed production of the new bomber. After building only 135 of the new machines, production was halted in order to change to a different type of engine and to correct other ongoing problems. Full-scale mass production finally began in June of 1943. Between then and the end of the war in August of 1945 a total of 1,133 of these aircraft were built. The B6N1 gave relatively good performance in combat—it was fast, but it continued to have an array of problems and was not much better than its predecessor, the B5N2. Another problem plagued the Jill—by the time it reached operational status, Japan was running out of aircraft carriers and skilled pilots to fly the high performance machine.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was built by Mitsubishi in response to a 1935 specification from the Japanese Imperial Navy for a long range bomber that could project Japanese air power deep into the Pacific. The G3M [Allied code-named "Nell"] entered service in late 1937 and, while it was initially a good machine, by the time of the Japanese entry into World War II it was obsolete. But having no newer alternative to it, the G3M remained in active service with the Japanese Imperial Navy throughout the entire war. Its career was also extended and enhanced by several of its stunning success during the early months of the war. The most famous of these was when squadrons of G3Ms attacked and sank the British Royal Navy battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser HMS Repulse in waters off the coast of Malaya on December 10, 1941. It is one of these G3M2s that is modeled here. These two splendid British capital ships had been ordered into the Pacific to bolster British forces in the defense of Singapore. Their loss was said to have given Winston Churchill one of his darkest days of World War II. Squadrons of G3Ms also sank the British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes. While the Nells did achieve early success, their obsolescence made them vulnerable to modern Allied fighters during the later years of the war. Just under 1000 of these machines were produced.]]>

<![CDATA[This was clearly the best Japanese fighter of World War II. It was built by Nakajima in response to a 1942 specification for a new high-performance fighter. The specifications were more than met when the first Ki-84 [Allied code-named "Frank"] took to the air in April of 1943. It was fast, had good protective armor [a rarity for Japanese aircraft], and excellent fire power. Between March 1943 and June 1945, a total of 3,514 of these fine fighters were manufactured. This has to be a tribute to the Japanese aeronautical industry, since the heavy American bombing of Japan was ravaging Japan's cities. Some of Nakajima's plants were placed underground. Even during the final phases of World War II, Nakajima was turning out 200 Ki-84s a month. However, the increasing shortages of materials, especially metals, prompted Nakajima to replace substantial sections of the fuselage and wings with wood. The Nakajima Ki-84's war record was outstanding and it was a match for any American or Allied fighter. The quality of the Ki-84 can be best appreciated by the fact that after the Japanese capitulation, numbers of Ki-84s were taken in hand by the United States Army Air Force and subjected to extensive evaluations that revealed that the Ki-84 was actually superior in performance to the American P-47 and P-51 fighters [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. These two American fighters were regarded as the best Allied fighters of World War II. The Nakajima Ki-84 was better.]]>

The first 691s did not reach operational units until the end of 1939, after the outbreak of World War II. In an effort to stem the German advance through the Low Countries in May of 1940, numbers of these attack bombers were deployed to Belgium where their performance was excellent. However, the entire French and Allied defense was crumbling and a few Bréguet 691s, as good as they were, could do little to stop the German onslaught.]]>

The PBM was also heavily armed with defensive firepower. The PBM was ordered in numbers by the United States Navy in an array of variants that were used for transports, air-sea rescue, and anti-submarine roles in addition to those of reconnaissance. A few PBMs were supplied to the British Royal Air Force and to the Royal Australian Air Force. These flying boats remained in U.S. Navy service for a number of years after World War II and surplus post-war machines were supplied to the Navies of Uruguay, Argentina, and the Netherlands. Overall, the PBM was a quite successful aircraft and was of substantial value to the Allied war effort.]]>

It was of all-metal construction with a three tail-plane configuration, gull wings with semi-retractable landing gear positioned at the lowest point in the wing's depression, and a unique cooling system with two radiators that were built into both proximal wing roots. The aircraft's performance was marginal due to what was deemed to be an inadequate power plant.

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was a direct descendent of the Me 210 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Me 210 had been a total failure. Based upon the reputation of Willy Messerschmitt, the Me 210's designer, the machine had been put in mass production before its prototypes had been fully tested. Many had been built before their performance was recognized as being very poor. Production was terminated and so was Willy Messerschmitt, who was forced to resign from the leadership of the company that he founded. Learning from the mistakes of the Me 210, Messerschmitt engineers, without their former leader, redesigned the Me 210. Thus, the Me 410 [modeled here] emerged. As faulty as was the Me 210, the Me 410 was excellent. The first newly designed Me 410 flew in late 1942 and its potential was immediately recognized. The Me 410 was subsequently built in a large number of variants for a variety of uses: heavy fighter, fighter bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, anti-shipping bomber, and night fighter. It had a pair of remotely controlled rear-firing defensive 13 mm machine guns manned by the rear facing gunner in the rear of the cockpit and it had very heavy forward-firing armament. Overall, it proved to be an excellent machine that made a huge contribution to the German war effort. During its entire production run, over 1,160 were built.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Bloch MB.210 was the Armée de l'Air's first modern medium bomber. Its all-metal construction and retractable landing gear set it apart form all previous French aircraft of the same type. The project began in 1933 and progressed through many design changes and through several prototype trials resulting in many modifications. The first definitive Bloch MB.210 made its first trial flight on December 12, 1935. Its performance was accepted by the French Air Ministry and production was ordered. Over the ensuing years, a total of 253 went into service with the Armée de l'Air. Numbers of others were also sold in export to Romania and the Republican forces fighting in the Spanish civil war. Although not originally recognized, it soon became clear with its operational use that the machine was underpowered and that this was having a serious adverse impact upon its performance. The French fleet of machines was retrofitted with more powerful engines, but this brought about marginal if any real improvement. When war began in September of 1939, the Bloch MB.210 was considered obsolete and the 150 aircraft in active service at that time faired poorly against modern German fighters during the Battle of France. Losses forced them to largely confine their operations to night. Following the French capitulation in June of 1940, numbers of these machines were transferred to the Armée de l'Air de l'Armistice of the Vichy government, where they remained in limited service mainly in reconnaissance and transport roles.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was developed at the same time and with the same intention as was the Heinkel He 111 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. They both were designed as civilian transports at a time when Germany, under the terms of the armistice that ended World War I, could build no military aircraft. However, the designers of both these machines had in its planning made provisions that made both aircraft easily converted to bombers. The Ju 86 first flew in November 4, 1934. It subsequently underwent several modifications and the aircraft began equipping the new German Luftwaffe in February of 1936. The Ju 86 was also sold in export to Chile, Hungary, and Portugal. They proved to be somewhat unreliable and inferior to the He 111s in German service. During the course of 1939, the Ju 86 was gradually removed from active bomber units and was relegated to bomber training schools and to high altitude reconnaissance units. Some later Ju 86P versions were employed in ultra-high bombing raids of England, dropping their bombs from 40,000 feet in altitude—at that height they were essentially immune from British fighter attack. The service careers of the ageing Ju 86s ended when they were removed from bomber flight training schools and their high-altitude bombing raids and were pressed into emergency service as transports in a vain attempt to supply the beleaguered German troops cut-off and surrounded in the Stalingrad perimeter. They did not fair well in this effort. Of the 58 Ju 86s that were deployed on these missions, 42 were lost over a two-month period. The survivors were returned to bomber flight schools after the German Stalingrad pocket surrendered in January of 1943.]]>

<![CDATA[The Fairey Firefly was designed by a Fairey Aviation team lead by its chief engineer H.E. Chaplin in response to an Admiralty specification issued for a new high-performance carrier-based reconnaissance fighter bomber. An order for 200 of these machines was placed in June 1940 and the first prototype flew on December 22, 1941. The first Fireflies were delivered to operational units of the Fleet Air Arm in March of 1943. The machine was of all-metal construction with fully retractable landing gear, drooping wing flaps for assistance in dive bombing, folding wings for space conservation on carriers, and a bubble-type of pilot's canopy providing excellent all-around vision. Multiple variants were subsequently produced over the months after the aircraft's introduction. Fireflies saw active service off the Norwegian coast against the German battleship Tirpitz, anchored in a Norwegian ford, and in the Mediterranean theater. Fireflies were involved in the defense against Fiesler Fi 103 V-1 "Buzz Bombs" [modeled elsewhere in this collection] by intercepting and destroying them in flight. In 1945, British aircraft carriers were deployed to the Pacific to assist United States forces in their actions against the Japanese. In June of 1945, Fireflies of No. 1771 Squadron [modeled here], operating from HMS Implacable, attacked Japanese positions in the Caroline Islands and Fireflies of No 1772 Squadron from HMS Indefatigable flew missions against the Japanese home islands. Following the war, updated variants of the Firefly remained in Fleet Air Arm service for several years.]]>

<![CDATA[This neat aircraft was the main elementary trainer for the French Armée de l'Air throughout the entire decade of the 1930s. In fact, almost all French pilots flying for the Armée de l'Air at the outbreak of World War II had had their earliest flight training in this machine. It was the equivalent of the Stearman trainer in the United States air services and the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the British Royal Air Force [both of the latter are modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The M.S.230 first flew in 1929 and proved to be an excellent and stable machine that was very easy to fly. It was placed into service in the military flight schools throughout France and was exported abroad to the air forces of numerous other countries. It also became a popular aircraft for sport aviation. The M.S.230 was of metal tubular framing with fabric covering throughout except the forward area of the fuselage, which was metal covered. It had a wide fixed landing gear that made it very stable in takeoff and landing. Unlike other trainers of the time that were largely biplanes, the M.S.230 was a high parasol wing monoplane. It did have the usual tandem cockpit arrangement in the fuselage for the instructor and pupil. Numbers of M.S.230s survived for many years after the war and became civilian trainers and civilian flying club aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1937, the air forces of the nations of the world were moving away from biplane fighters to monoplane designs. However, the Soviet Air Force seemed to be wed to the biplane and its maneuverability and agility. In this regard, the Red Air Force ordered Aleksei Ya Shcherbakov, one of Polikarpov's principle design engineers, to produce a new biplane fighter. The result was the I-153. Since in its design the former gull upper wing configuration of the older I-15 was again employed, the old term Chaika ["Gull"] was revisited and applied to the I-153. The new I-153 was quite similar in appearance to the I-152 save the gull shaped upper wing. However, the structure of the newer I-153 was made much stronger and a manually retractable landing gear was added. A new more powerful Shvetsov engine was substituted for the older I-152's engine. Production of the I-153 began in the Spring of 1939 and continued through 1940, 3,437 were built during that time. The I-153, despite its obsolete appearance, remained in front line service until late 1943. It survived by being agile, thus escaping its enemies. How many of those enemies it shot down is unknown, but since it remained in action so long, there must have been some. Before the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany, like other Polikarpov fighters, the I-153 was also sent to the Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War. Other I-153s were sent to China, where they joined the older Polikarpovs already in service there.]]>

It placed orders for the military version that was given the designation of L-5. Well over 2,000 of these aircraft were built. They served with distinction throughout the war in several roles. Numbers were sent under the Lend-Lease program to Great Britain. In British service they were largely deployed in the Far East and Burma theaters of operation as reconnaissance aircraft, liaison transports, and air ambulances.

<![CDATA[This was the first twin-engine aircraft built by the Cessna Aircraft Company and designated as Model T-50. It was intended as a five-passenger light transport. It was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction. Its wings and tail were of wood, its fuselage was of welded steel tubing with fabric covering, and its landing gear were partly retractable. After the aircraft's first test flights, the United States Army Air Force recognized the potential for the aircraft as a multi-engine trainer and ordered production of the machine. Some 550 were also supplied to the British under Lend-Lease. Given their largely wooden construction, they acquired the nickname "Bamboo Bomber" although, in fact, the Bobcat was never used as a bomber. These aircraft were built in a variety of versions. They all looked very much alike and varied mostly in power plants and in internal equipment, which was dependent upon their role. Their main use was in training, communication, utility, and passenger transport work. Over 3,400 were manufactured during their entire production]]>

The United States Army Air Force first took delivery of these machines in 1939 for use as primary trainers for their flight schools. They were the first U.S. Army trainers that were monoplanes and the first to be of all-metal construction. The first order was for fifteen YPT-16s for service evaluation. This was followed by a production order for thirty PT-20 trainers that were essentially the same as the YPT-16. At the request of the Army Air Force, a hundred PT-21s were ordered with a 132 hp Kinner R-440-3 air-cooled radial engine. The final order was for 1,023 PT-22, which were the same as the PT-21 but with a 160 hp Kinner R-540 radial engine, no wheel spats, and landing gear fairings. The PT-22 was the first version given the name "Recruit," which is now accepted as the name for all versions. The United States Army and the Navy employed the Ryan trainer throughout the war.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was the first in a long line of aircraft carrier-based fighters that were designed and built for the United States Navy by the Grumman Company. Indeed, beginning with the introduction of the Grumman FF, the company built a succession of fighter types for the Navy that extended over the next four decades. When it first entered service in 1933, the Grumman FF was unique in having a closed cockpit and retractable landing gear, features not found in contemporary machines of the time. The first aircraft were delivered to operational squadrons of the Navy in April of 1933. The Grumman FF served in front line service with United States Navy aircraft carriers until they began being replaced by the more modern Grumman F3F fighters in early 1936. Thirty-four were delivered to Spain and were known as "Delfín" and 15 were assembled by Canadian Car and Foundry for RCAF use and were identified as "Goblin." By the time of the entry of the United States into World War II, all of the Grumman FFs had been totally retired from front line service. Most had been scraped but a few were still in use as trainers during the first few months of the war. All of them had been struck from service by late 1942.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1938, the Italian Air Ministry ordered this machine from Caproni in order to replace Italy's existing outdated reconnaissance aircraft. The new aircraft was to be of modern design and while it was to be used mainly in the reconnaissance role, it was specified that the new aircraft should have features that would also enable it to perform as a light bomber and ground attack aircraft. The Ca.311 that was subsequently produced was aerodynamically streamlined, had twin engines, and a fully glazed nose to allow for excellent visibility for the pilot and crew. The first prototypes flew in 1939 and government orders were then placed for production. The machines saw first action in the support of Italian ground forces in North Africa in 1940.The aircraft proved to be seriously underpowered and it was soon learned that it was seriously lacking in defensive armament in combat. Despite these major faults, the Ca.311s labored on in Italian campaigns in Africa, the Balkans, and in the Soviet Union giving only modestly successful service. They, however, remained operational throughout the entire war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Italy never succeeded in producing a truly good ground attack aircraft during World War II. The Ba.65 came the closest. The aircraft entered service in 1935 with an intended duel role of not only fighter but also ground attack. After experience in the Spanish Civil War, it became very clear that the machine was under powered, too slow and too poorly maneuverable to compete with modern fighters of the day. When Italy entered the war in June of 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had 154 of these machines in front line service. Given their deficiency as fighters, they were primarily deployed in the role of ground support for the Italian forces in North Africa, where they proved to be easy prey for British fighters. Little is recorded about the Ba.65s after the defeat of the Axis powers in North Africa, but it is very doubtful that they could have stood up to the modern American and British aircraft that they would have had to confront during the subsequent Italian campaigns. Performance data provided is for the Ba-65/A.80.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Dornier Do 24 was designed to fulfill a requirement put forward by the Royal Dutch Navy for a flying boat to be used in the patrol of that nation's East Indies colonies. The fuselage configuration of the Do 24 was roughly similar to its predecessor, the Do 18. However, the Do 24's was larger and accommodated living and sleeping quarters for the crew in view of the machine's operational pattern of being away from its base for long intervals. A wing mounted three-engine format was selected and the Dutch specified the use of American Wright Cyclone engines. The machine first flew on January 10, 1938, and twenty four Do 24s were sent to the Dutch East Indies, where they fought against the Japanese during the course of World War II. The German Luftwaffe initially displayed little interest in the new flying boat, since they felt that their existing Blohm & Voss BV 138 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] met its maritime reconnaissance needs. However, as the European war progressed and Germany swept over the European Continent, its needs inspired an interest in the Do 24. The occupied Dutch factories of the Fokker Company, now under German control, began manufacturing the Do 24 in numbers for Germany, but German power plants were substituted for the Wright-Cyclone engines. The Do 24s were quickly recognized for their speed and range. The Luftwaffe used the machines in many roles: reconnaissance, maritime transport, ship convoy, air ambulance, and air-sea rescue. They functioned in all maritime theaters of the German war: the English Channel, the Baltic, the Atlantic, the North Atlantic, the Artic, the Mediterranean, and the Aegean Seas. Their ruggedness and their ability to land and take-off in very rough seas were their greatest virtues. Many downed German airman owed their lives to a Do 24. The Do 24 was one of the few German World War II aircraft that was not built in many variants. None survived the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[By the terms of the treaty ending World War I, Germany could not manufacture military aircraft. Willy Messerschmitt, the founder of the German aircraft company bearing his name, was thus occupied in building gliders and civilian aircraft. The Bf 108 [modeled here] was one such civilian aircraft. When World War II erupted years later, the Bf 108 was turned to military use as a light transport and trainer. The Bf 108 was of all-metal construction except control surfaces that were fabric-covered. It was of low mono-wing design with a small cockpit where its two occupants sat side by side with duel controls. During the war years, numbers of these machines were handed over to Germany's allies—in this case to Bulgaria where it was used as a trainer. The Bf 108 had another use; it was the forerunner of the Bf 109, the famous World War II German fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection] that was built in the tens of thousands by Messerschmitt prior to and during the war. The design similarities can be seen in the two machines.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Curtiss company designed and built the SC Seahawk in response to a United States Navy specification issued in 1942 for a new fast, high-performance reconnaissance aircraft. The new machine was to be built with interchangeable under carriage—either wheels for land use or a single center float with wing fitted outrider floats for water use. The wings of the float planes were to fold for shipboard storage. Curtiss submitted their design proposals in August of 1942 and received a contract for production in March of 1943. The machine was of all-metal construction and was intended to replace the existing reconnaissance aircraft currently in service with the Navy. The first prototype made its maiden flight on February 16, 1944, and production aircraft began equipping naval units in October of that year, the first machine going to the Battle Cruiser USS Guam. The painting of these aircraft was the Navy standard of the timerk blue and medium blue on upper surfaces with white on under surfaces. SC Seahawks remained in service aboard United States Navy battleships and cruisers well after the war until they were replaced by helicopters.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1938 at the same time that the new Kawanishi H6K flying boat [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was beginning to enter service, the Japanese Imperial Navy requested Kawanishi to design and build an even larger and more powerful flying boat to supplement or even replace the H6K. The H8K2 [modeled here] was of all-metal construction with stressed skin exterior. Its fuselage and overall appearance were similar from the British Short Sunderland Flying Boat [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. From the first flights of its prototypes in January of 1941, it was obvious that the H8K2 [code named "Emily" by the Allies] was a very fine machine and exceeded all the Japanese Navy's specifications regarding speed, weight of armament, performance, and most importantly range. Production of the new flying boat began in late 1941 and the machines began equipping the Japanese Navy in early 1942, just in time to begin patrolling Japan's vast new captured Pacific empire. Prior to that, an early prototype version of this aircraft had made reconnaissance flights over the Hawaiian Islands, gathering information prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. These flying boats were worked very hard throughout the entire war, not only in reconnaissance but also in the bombing and anti-submarine roles. A total of 162 of these large aircraft were built. Their defensive armament was very adequate leading Allied airmen to assign it the name "the flying porcupine"—again like the German airmen had come to refer to the British Short Sunderland Flying Boat.]]>

<![CDATA[Like their counterparts in Europe, the Japanese High Command realized the importance of having a short takeoff and landing [STOL] aircraft. In early 1940, the Kokusai Company was instructed to build such a machine along the lines of the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The resulting machine designed and built by Kokusai, the Ki-76 [Allied code-named "Stella"], first flew in May of 1941. It was a success and had outstanding performance similar to the German Storch. The Kokusai Ki-76 was employed in various roles: reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and light transport duties. It is not generally realized that during World War II, the Japanese Army had within its service and under its control a number of small aircraft carriers that were apart and separate form those of the Japanese Imperial Navy. Perhaps the most unusual use of the "Stella" was aboard the Japanese Army Aircraft Carrier Akitsu Maru, where it was employed in the anti-submarine reconnaissance role. Its short takeoff and landing ability made it ideal for the smaller deck of this vessel.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was one of the finest tactical bombers of World War II and ranks along with the British de Havilland Mosquito and the German Junkers Ju 88 [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It originated in 1938 when Vladimir Mikhailovich Petlyakov was charged by the Soviet government with designing a new bomber. He had been released from a Soviet political prison specifically to create this new machine. The result was a low-wing two-engine monoplane with a twin tail. It made its first flight in late 1939. Aerodynamic wing brakes and a pressurized cockpit were added. These and other modifications were required, but the Pe-2 proved to have excellent performance. The bomber joined the Red Air Force in the Spring of 1941, just prior to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Pe-2 was subsequently built in several variants: bomber, ground attack aircraft, anti-tank aircraft, dive bomber, night fighter, and reconnaissance platform, all of that served with great distinction until the very end of the war. Ironically, V.M. Petlyakov, the machine's designer, was killed it the second prototype of the Pe-2 when it crashed during its initial test flight. The importance of this aircraft to the Soviet war effort can be judged by the final production figures—no fewer than 11,427 of all variants were built. They remained in service with the Soviet Air Force and with the Eastern Bloc countries for many years after World War II.]]>

The aircraft could be fitted with either wheels or with floats as was the case with this model of the K5Y2 [Allied code-named "Willow"]. The machine saw extensive service at naval training schools throughout Japan during the entirety of World War II. Japanese policy was to paint their aircraft, whose operational activity was confined to the home islands, a bright orange—this to avoid friendly fire from home defenses. The prototype of this model was so painted and shows weathering from its heavy use in a sea water environment.]]>

The Ki-32 [Allied code-named "Mary"] saw extensive action in the Japanese-Chinese war from 1938 until 1943. A total of 854 Ki-32s were manufactured. By the time of the Japanese entry into World War II, the machine was obsolete. Some Ki-32s did participate in attacks on Hong Kong in 1942, but the aircraft had been largely relegated to training and secondary duties by 1943.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was developed from the Bloch MB.170, a bomber that entered service in the early 1930s and was hopelessly obsolete. In fact, it was completely out of service by the beginning of World War II. The Bloch MB.174 made its first flight on January 5, 1939, just 8 months before the outbreak of WWII. It displayed excellent handling characteristics, had good performance and was ordered into immediate production. Fifty machines had been built by the time of the German invasion of France in May of 1940. Bloch MB.174s had entered service with the Armée de l'Air prior to that invasion in late March of 1940 and were highly regarded by their crews. During the Battle of France, the machine performed well and only a very few were lost to enemy action. After French capitulation in June of 1940, the only unit flying the Bloch MB.174 was GR II/33 that was operating in the French North African colonies under Vichy French control. Following the Allied invasion of North Africa [Operation Torch] and the Allied occupation of the French colonies, GR II/33 and their Bloch MB.174s began flying alongside the Allies. Numbers of Bloch MB.174s remained in active service throughout the remainder of the war in the reconnaissance bomber role. They proved to be one of the best French aircraft of WWII and served with distinction.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[After their successful roles in combat during the Battle of Britain, Hurricanes were sent to North Africa to support the British 8th Army. Many of these were of the Mk II C variant [modeled here]. While they continued to be engaged to some extent in air combat with the Italian and German air forces, the Mk II C version was modified to carry two 20 mm cannon in each wing and was being used extensively in the ground attack role against German and Italian tanks and other armor. The sand environment required that Hurricanes operating in the Western Desert be fitted with Vokes filters to protect their radiators and oil coolers. The filter was a recognizable feature protruding from under the nose of the aircraft just behind the propeller. The aircraft modeled was one of three Hurricanes that had been donated to the Royal Air Force by Lady Rachel MacRoberts in memory of her three sons who had all been killed while flying for the Royal Air Force. Hurricane II Cs operated in the North Africa Theater from May 1941 through May 1944. The typical camouflage of RAF aircraft flying in the desert was a sand and light brown pattern on their upper surfaces and a sky blue on their under surfaces. This model reflects this scheme.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Dornier Do 18 was designed as a successor to the older highly successful Dornier Do 15 Wal [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It began as a civilian mail transport aircraft flying for the German airline Lufthansa but was soon converted to military purposes. The Do 18 first flew on March 15, 1935. It began in civilian service later that year and made many record breaking flights before beginning routine mail routes to South American. Military versions of the machine began to be delivered to the Luftwaffe in 1936. The Do 18 had two engines positioned in tandem in a common housing above its flying boat type fuselage. Its pilots sat side by side in an enclosed cockpit. Modifications were made in the original machine resulting in the G variant [modeled here] that had better power plants, an aerodynamically improved fuselage, and better defensive armament. These aircraft were used primarily for reconnaissance flights in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the areas of the Norwegian coastline. It was a Do 18 flying boat that had the dubious distinction of being the first German aircraft to be shot down in World War II—this on September 26, 1939 by a British Blackburn Skua fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection] from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.]]>

The machine was active during the Japanese occupation of China during the late 1930s in various reconnaissance roles. Although it was becoming obsolete by the time of the United States entry into World War II in December of 1941, the Kawanishi E7K1 [Allied code name Alf] remained in service during the first years of the war until it was replaced by more modern reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to shipboard service, it saw extensive use in patrolling the Japanese occupied islands of the Pacific.

<history>
<![CDATA[Many aviation historians regard the Fiat G.55 as one of the very best fighters of World War II. Designed by Fiat engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, the aircraft first flew on April 30, 1942. Its performance was outstanding and production was ordered to begin with the first production models being put in service in June of 1943. By the time of the Italian armistice in September of 1943, the Regia Aeronautica had 16 of these modern new fighters. Everything changed after the armistice. The 16 machines of the Regia Aeronautica joined the Italian Cobelligerent Air Force and flew along side the Allied air forces. However, the Fiat factories were located in the Northern region of Italy that remained under German control. This part of Italy formed a puppet government, the RSI [Repubblica Sociale Italiana], subservient to Nazi Germany. Production of the Fiat G.55 continued under German control with 164 G.55s being built for the new RSI Air Force before the Fiat factory was destroyed by Allied bombing on April 25, 1944, putting an end to production. Thus, the majority of Fiat G.55 fighters flew for the RSI against the Allies. Their armament was excellent and their performance matched or exceeded any Allied fighter of the time, especially at high altitude. The machines established an outstanding record despite their small numbers. Following the war Italy resumed production of the G.55s, exporting many to foreign air forces around the world. Some of these excellent aircraft remained in service into the 1950s. Some were equipped to carry a 2,046-pound (930-kg) torpedo under the fuselage centerline.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Designed by Roberto Longhi and Antonio Alessi of the Reggiane company, the Reggiane Re.2001 had a blunted career. Its development was delayed due to the lack of an adequate power plant. This problem was apparently resolved when the German Daimler Benz DB 601 inline engine became available. This required revisions in the intended airframe, which had originally been designed for a radial engine. The first Re.2001 flew in June of 1940 about the same time Italy entered World War II as Germany's ally. Its performance was excellent but the Regia Aeronautica, for that it was designed, sought multiple changes and modifications that greatly delayed the machine's mass production, resulting in the first aircraft not reaching the Regia Aeronautica until late in 1941. Worse, as production progressed, the Daimler Benz engines became in short supply. Only 40 machines were completed in 1941 and only 100 were built in all of 1942 and the first 6 months of 1943. Most were equipped with a DB 601A built under license, the Alpha-Romeo RA 1000 RC41-1a Monosone engine. Those Re.2001s that were built equipped Italian fighter units beginning in December of 1941. Their performance and combat record was good, but remained in the shadows of the Italian family of Macchi fighters [all modeled elsewhere in this collection]. With the Italian capitulation in September of 1943, numbers of these Re.2001 fighters were incorporated into the Co-belligerent Air Force and flew with the Allies. It is one of these machines that is modeled here. The Reggiane Re.2001 was followed by two further members of this family of Italian fighters that are also modeled in this collection.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Marchetti to replace the SM.79 and the SM.81 [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Like in so many other situations during World War II, the intended replacement did not perform as well as the machine it was intended to replace. While having much the same lines and the same three-engine configuration as its two predecessors, the SM.84 had more powerful engines and improved avionics. It first flew on June 4, 1940, just days before Italy entered World War II as an ally of Germany. The Regia Aeronautica subsequently placed orders for 309 of the new bombers the first of that entered operational service in February of 1941. They proved to be satisfactory in the role of level bombers but their lack of maneuverability, as compared to the older SM.79, rendered them unsuitable for the role of torpedo bomber, a role in that the older SM.79 performed so well. Efforts were made to modify the SM.84 to enable it to have better performance, but none of these changes brought it up to the standards of the SM.79. The SM.84, in all its variants, was operational with Regia Aeronautica bomber squadrons until the Italian armistice in September of 1943 after that time some flew for the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force with the Allied Air Forces. A few others were seized by the Germans and were employed with the Luftwaffe as transports until the end of the war.]]>

</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[The concept of an autogyro aircraft dates back to the 1920s. Equipped with the usual "tractor" forward positioned engine driving its propeller, the autogyro had, in place of traditional wings, a large freely turning three bladed rotor that provided aerodynamic lift for the machine as it moved through the air. This gave autogyros a very short take-off and landing ability and exceptional maneuverability, but far less forward speed than conventional fixed winged aircraft. The Spanish aeronautical engineer Juan de la Cierva was a pioneer in the design of this type of aircraft and, prior to World War II, he was invited by the British government to come to England to demonstrate his machine that he then called the Cierva C.6A. Great Britain subsequently ordered 10 of his autogyros. During the 1930s, they served with the British School of Army Cooperation at Old Sarum, England. However, the autogyros aroused little interest in the Royal Air Force until the outbreak of World War II. Confronted with the new war, the RAF ordered the British Avro Company to build de la Cierva's C.30 autogyro under license. Virtually all of the British Avro autogyros, that were designated Avro 671 Rotas, were used for coastal radar calibration, a role in that their flight characteristics suited them well. In June of 1943, the Royal Air Force created No. 529 Squadron, the first unit in the RAF to be operational while entirely equipped with rotary-winged aircraft. No. 529 Squadron remained in active service until disbanded in October of 1945.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was a member of the Potez 63 family of machines that were designed and built by the French aircraft company Potez to fulfill a French Air Ministry 1934 specification for a new aircraft that could perform three missions: heavy fighter, night fighter, and reconnaissance aircraft capable of providing radio control of French single seat fighters during combat. The first Potez 63 prototype flew on April 25, 1936. Its trials were successful and production of the three variants began soon thereafter. Units of the Armée de l'Air began receiving the Potez 63s in late 1938. In June of 1940 when Germany was invading France, the Armée de l'Air had 1,100 Potez 63s of different variants in service. The 63.11A-3 [modeled here] was a reconnaissance/communication variant employed in the control of French fighters attempting to counter Luftwaffe aircraft as they supported the German Blitzkrieg. Following the French capitulation in June of 1940, 250 Potez 63s of different types were taken over by the Germans and flew with the Luftwaffe, mainly in transport and liaison roles. Others were given by the Germans to the Italian Regia Aeronautica and still others to the Romanian Air force. Those in the French colonies overseas at the time of the French capitulation flew for Vichy France.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This relatively small naval shipboard fighter resembles the United States Boeing P-26 Peashooter [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Mitsubishi A5M4 [modeled here] marked a substantial change in Japanese aircraft. It was the first Japanese naval monoplane fighter, the first all-metal fighter, and the first fighter to be entirely designed and built by Japanese technology and not based upon Western imports or design—although as mentioned, the A5M4 did look like the Boeing P-26. The A5M4 [Allied code-named "Claude"] first flew in February of 1935 and was an immediate success. It equipped Japanese aircraft carrier fighter groups throughout the prewar years and during the early years of World War II until it was gradually replaced by the famous Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The Claude was very active during the Chinese-Japanese conflict leading up to World War II. However, by the end of 1943, they all had been retired. The excellent handling qualities made the machines very popular with their pilots. The Claude had the distinction of being the last Japanese fighter to have an open cockpit.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This version of the Spitfire was the first major variant to follow the famous Mk I of Battle of Britain fame [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. During the early months of the war, it became obvious to the Royal Air Force that the standard eight machine gun armament of its fighters was not adequate. Experience had shown that even when their fighter pilots raked their enemy target with heavy fire, the small rifle caliber bullets often did little damage unless they hit the pilot or vital engine parts—both difficult to do. It was decided that cannon armament like that carried by the German fighters was required. The Spitfire Mk V [modeled here] had its wings modified to accept two 20 mm cannon. This required the distinctive humps be placed on the top surfaces of the wings to accommodate the cannon's magazines. The Spitfire Mk V was the first variant to serve overseas. Some were sent to North Africa and others to the Mediterranean island of Malta. Still others were sent to the Far East and Australia. All served well in the role of an interceptor and fighter. A few were fitted with bombs and functioned in the role of fighter/bomber attacking ground targets. A total of 6,478 Mk Vs were produced—the most of any Spitfire variant.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Focke-Wulf Fw 183 was the final World War II aircraft to come from the prolific drawing board of Kurt Tank, Focke-Wulf's chief designer and engineer. The designator Ta assigned to this machine reflects the recognition rendered to Tank. Great interest in jet propulsion was being exhibited by the German Air Ministry, which realized that just about all-possible efficiency had been obtained from piston engines driving propellers. Jet engines were going to power the aircraft of the future. In early January of 1945, approval was given for the production of eight pre-production Ta 183s. They were to have jet engines and were projected to have speeds of up to 600 mph, but their manufacture was impacted by the collapse of Germany. Eight prototypes were built. Preliminary flight testing may have been carried out, although this is unclear. None achieved combat status. The manufacturing plant of the Ta 183 was captured by advancing Soviet troops. Those Ta 183 aircraft that had been completed and their design plans fell into Soviet hands. Although there is a strong resemblance between the MiG-15 and the Ta 183, the MiG-15 was actually developed from the MiG-9 and not influenced by the Focke-Wolf design.]]>

<![CDATA[This seaplane was built for the Royal Netherlands Navy by Fokker. It made its first flight in 1938. The machine gave good performance in its test flights and 40 were ordered by the Dutch government but none were combat ready when Germany invaded the Netherlands in May of 1940. Ten of these seaplanes escaped to England, where they flew for the British Coastal Command doing reconnaissance patrols in the North Sea and in the Mediterranean. The T.VIIIs that remained in the Netherlands after the German occupation were taken over by the Luftwaffe and were employed in the same reconnaissance role in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Thus, the same aircraft was flying in the same theater of operation [the North Sea] on different sides of the conflict.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed by Dr. Erich Schatzki, a design engineer with the Fokker Company. It was of a radically new design with a central fuselage nacelle and twin tail booms behind twin radial engines. The central nacelle housed 8 machine guns positioned in a line across its nose. The Fokker G.I made its first flight on March 16, 1937. The first production order for 25 of the new fighters was placed by the Spanish Republican government, but a subsequent Dutch ban on any arms shipment to the warring factions in Spain prevented all but 6 from being shipped. The other 19 were taken by the Royal Dutch Air Force. At the time of the German invasion of the Netherlands in May of 1940, the Fokker G.Is were still being evaluated and equipped. Most had no guns. These aircraft played no significant role in the brief and unsuccessful defense of the Netherlands, although they did destroy several Ju 52/3ms used in the five-day invasion. Following the fall of the Netherlands, the German Luftwaffe used a few of the captured existing Fokker G.Is as advanced trainers but no more were ever manufactured. A G.IB version utilizing the Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine was considered as an option, but never built. The A and B designations were not used at the time but have been adopted as a convenience in identifying the different versions.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This two engine aircraft was built by the French aircraft company Potez to fulfill a 1932 specification for a new reconnaissance bomber. It first flew on November 14, 1933. Production machines began equipping units of the Armée de l'Air one year later. A total of 192 Potez 540s were built. The Potez 540 was a high wing monoplane of mixed wood and metal covering over a steel tube framing. Its landing gear retracted into the lower aspect of its engine housings. Their first combat was in the Spanish Civil War, where they were employed by the Spanish Republicans. In the later 1930s, these aircraft were becoming obsolete so they were withdrawn from reconnaissance and bombing duties and were relegated to French transport units. They were also employed as paratrooper training and transport aircraft. By September of 1939 and the beginning of World War II, they had been largely transferred to the French colonies in North Africa, where they continued to function in transport and paratrooper service. Their role in even these secondary assignments was problematic given their poor defensive armament and vulnerability to modern enemy fighters. Following the French capitulation to Germany in June of 1940, those Potez 540s still flying served the Vichy French Air Force mainly in the French overseas colonies. Most of these machines were retired or destroyed by late 1943.]]>

It became a part of the new German air service and armed with two rifle caliber machine guns it equipped the first fighter unit of the new Luftwaffe, the Jagdgeschwader "Richthofen" [named after Germany's famous World War I fighter ace]. Some He 51s were sent to Spain during the Spanish Civil war to fly with the Condor Legion. By the time of the onset of World War II He 51s had been withdrawn form front line combat service and were mainly being employed as advanced trainers. Some of the Luftwaffe flight training schools were located in the countries that Germany had occupied. The prototype of this model was in a Luftwaffe flight school in Yugoslavia.]]>

<![CDATA[The Aichi E13A1 [Allied code name "Jake"] was designed in 1938 as a catapult-launched reconnaissance float plane for the Japanese Imperial Navy's Battleships and Cruisers. It entered service in that role in late 1938 and served throughout the entirety of World War II. A total of 1,418 were constructed. This aircraft was unusual in that it remained essentially unchanged without significant modification during its entire history. This was very unusual as Japanese aviation engineers and Japanese military leaders were noted for constantly changing and modifying their aircraft. The Aichi E13A1 was but one of a large number of different reconnaissance seaplane types built and used by the Japanese Navy during WWII. This large variety meant that no single type could be built in large numbers—a strange policy, indeed, as it reduced the productivity of the Japanese aircraft industry that was constantly changing its equipment and tooling to accommodate the many new types and new versions of established types.]]>

Upon the aircraft's return the mother ship, it would turn cross-wise to the direction of the wind and waves blocking them in order to give the returning seaplane the smoothest possible sea surface upon that to land. A crane would then hoist the seaplane back aboard ship to await the next launch.]]></comments>

The machine was manufactured in both seaplane and land configurations, the latter flying from Royal Navy aircraft carriers and the float planes serving as catapulted observation aircraft for battleships and cruisers and flying from naval shore facilities. Several improvements in its power plant resulted in sequential Marks [Mk] following its introduction. The Shark's front-line service was brief despite upgrades—they were replaced by Fairey Swordfish [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in 1938. Some of these machines were employed as target tugs after the outbreak of World War II. Numbers of them based at Gosport, England, towed lighted flares during night operations to illuminate German U-boats in the English Channel as they attempted to attack the Dunkirk evacuation. Sharks also fought in Seletar attacking Japanese positions in Batu Pahat. The aircraft remained operational until August of 1944 when all were retired—some having served for over a decade.]]>

<![CDATA[The Fairchild Aircraft Corporation of Hagerstown, Maryland, introduced this aircraft as a light civilian passenger transport Fairchild Model 24 in 1933. It remained in production for civilian service until World War II began in September of 1939. Model 24s were powered either by an inverted inline Ranger engine [modeled here] or an air-cooled Warner radial engine. Recognizing the need for reconnaissance and light utility aircraft, the United States Army began purchasing these machines in late 1940. The Coast Guard obtained four of these aircraft in 1936. The Army Air Force designated these aircraft UC-61, the Navy and Coast Guard the J2K. The Army used the machines for the transport of ferry pilots and general utility service, the Navy and Coast Guard for coastal Reconnaissance. The largest number of the military versions of the Forwarder were transferred to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program. The British called the aircraft the "Argus" and employed many of them in the Middle East and in India, where they proved to be very reliable. Of the 512 obtained by the United States military, 364 were given over to Britain. The prototype of this model was assigned to the United States Coast Guard and was stationed in South Carolina, where it was employed in coastal patrol duties.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Designed by Arado engineer Walter Blume, the Ar 95 was conceived as a coastal patrol aircraft with the capability of light attack. It was of all-metal construction with parallel-chord wings—the top wing more narrow thus allowing for better upper vision, the lower wing wider and thicker to enable easy access to the cockpit that was enclosed with a sliding canopy. The aircraft first flew in the summer of 1937, but the machine was not immediately embraced by the German Air Force. As a result, Arado turned to foreign export for its new machine. Some were employed by the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War, others were sold to Chile and Turkey. With the outbreak of World War II, orders were finally placed for the Ar 95 by the Luftwaffe. The Chilean order was shipped abroad but the Turkish order was diverted to Germany. The Ar 95 served throughout most of the war in the role for that it was designed and was mainly used by the above unit in the Baltic Sea area during German campaigns in that region.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Yokosuka E14Y-1 holds a very unique place in the History of World War II. It was the only Aircraft to bomb the continental United States during the war. Like the German Arado Ar 231 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the E14Y-1 was designed to be carried aboard a large submarine. The aircraft was stowed in a tubular water-tight hanger on the deck of the submarine and was assembled and disassembled before and after its flights. While the concept of the aircraft-carrying submarine was to use the aircraft for reconnaissance, on one occasion the Yokosuka E14Y-1 [Allied code-named "Glen"] was fitted with four 168-pound incendiary bombs [replacing its second crewmember] and was deployed to bomb the United States. The plan was to drop the incendiary devices into the woods of Oregon starting raging forest fires. It was hoped that this would cause great destruction of the American Northwest. The Japanese had not done their research adequately and did not realize that this area has huge amounts of annual rainfall. In fact, the region they bombed is an actual rain forest. The bombs that were dropped did not start a single significant fire due to the wet forest floor.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Although the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had already been adopted by the Luftwaffe as its standard fighter, Heinkel engineers designed and built the He 100. It was a streamlined fast and impressive machine. A pre-production prototype set a world speed record of 463 mph in level flight in March of 1939. One prototype, the He 100 C, carried devastating fire power for the time: two 20 mm cannon and four 7.9 mm machine guns. The original innovative cooling system created some problems, along with handling problems that required enlarging the tail surfaces brought its operational suitability into question. Several pre-production prototypes and 12 production aircraft were manufactured. These were used primarily for propaganda photographs deceptively implying the He 100 was an important part of the German fighter force. As close as the He 100s came to actual deployment was their use in a special small unit that protected the Heinkel Factory in Rostock, Germany.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Early in World War II, the Japanese Imperial Navy wanted a high-speed bomber capable of both horizontal and dive bombing and that could carry a ton of bombs. The result of these specifications was the Yokosuka P1Y1 Ginga [Allied code-named "Frances"]. The first machine flew in June of 1942. Its performance was considered adequate and the aircraft was placed into mass production. A total of 1,100 examples of all variants were built. Ninety-six of these were modified into night fighters to counter the devastating American B-29 night raids on Japanese cities and industry. The aircraft modeled is such a night fighter. These aircraft were fitted with two oblique upward firing 20 mm cannon in their mid fuselage. The concept was to fly below the high-flying B-29s and fire their cannon into the formations of American bombers flying above. The concept proved problematic and not terribly successful. The "Frances" was plagued throughout its career by engine problems, especially when flying at high altitudes—problems that were never fully resolved before the end of the war. Overall, the P1Y2's contribution to the Japanese war effort must be considered mediocre at best.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Mitsubishi in response to a 1935 Japanese Imperial Navy specification for a new bomber for use on its aircraft carriers. The machine was to have a crew of three, folding wings for flight deck storage, a speed of not less than 200 mph, a flight endurance of not less than 7 hours, and the ability to carry at least 1,760 pounds of bombs—a tall order for a single engine aircraft of the mid 1930s. In the design and building of the B5M1 [Allied code-named "Mabel"], the Japanese obtained a great deal of useful information from an American built Northrop A5 bomber that they had purchased, brought to Japan, dismantled, and analyzed. The aircraft that Mitsubishi produced first flew in 1937 and was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed undercarriage with large wheel spats. The crew of three sat in a long canopy that had a smooth transition to the fuselage. The B5M1s began equipping Japanese Naval units in late 1937, but their performance was never as satisfactory as was that of other Japanese aircraft carrier-based bombers. The B5M1's performance was considered marginal and only 145 were manufactured. While they had originally been intended for aircraft carrier use, the majority were employed during the early months of World War II from land bases in Southeast Asia and in China, where they were confronted by weak or no enemy fighter opposition. These machines ended their careers as trainers, target tugs, and suicide bombers.]]>

The machine entered service in 1937 as a civilian mail plane and as a light passenger transport for the new Aeroflot Airlines. The Soviet military took delivery of numbers of the aircraft and modified them for use as ground attack bombers adding a dorsal turret, fixed forward-firing machine guns, and bomb racks. However, the Nemans were designed for much of the same role as were the Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik attack bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Nemans could not compete with the Shturmoviks, so their production was terminated in 1940 with only 490 having been manufactured. The Neman aircraft were deployed with a small number of Red Army combat units during the first years of World War II until they were replaced by the Shturmoviks.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was probably the best French bomber of World War II. In fact, when it first entered service in late 1939, just weeks before the outbreak of World War II, it was one of the world's better medium bombers and had a speed equal to many contemporary fighters. It was built by Lioré et Olivier in response to an Armée de l'Air specification for a new high performance medium bomber. A prototype made its first flight on January 16, 1937. With excellent performance in its initial trials, the machine was taken in hand by the Armée de l'Air for additional study that revealed deficiencies that required almost two years to correct. The first combat units received these bombers just weeks before the outbreak of the war. During the first nine months of the war, when there was little action [the "phony war"], production of the LeO 451 proceeded at a rapid rate so that in May of 1940, when Germany invaded France, the Armée de l'Air had 222 of these machines. Unfortunately, only about half were ready for operational flight. Those that were available performed well demonstrating their high speed, excellent defensive armament, and good bomb load. Following the French capitulation in June of 1940, numbers of these bombers were taken over by the Vichy French Air Force and operated mainly in the French Colonies of North Africa. The German Luftwaffe showed little interest in the machines using a few for transports. The Germans did transfer numbers of LeO 451s to the Italian Regia Aeronautica, where they did see some limited service in the bombing role against the Allies. Sixty-seven of these bombers returned to service in the French Air Force after World War II. The last of these were operational until September of 1957—a durability that bespeaks the quality of the machines.]]>

The upgrading of its engine only marginally improved its performance. However, instead of shipboard duties, He 60s began to be deployed to Kriegsmarine training units in the late 1930s. Its water handling qualities bested its air handling. However, the machine equipped several Staffel when World War II began. The He 60, despite being very vulnerable to enemy fighter attack because of its sedate performance, continued to serve in coastal patrol work in the Baltic and the Mediterranean Seas during the early months of the war. All He 60s were struck from service by October of 1943.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This medium bomber was clearly the most modern and best aircraft available to the Polish Air Force on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded and began World War II. Although the PZL.37 was the best Polish machine, it is unexplainable that only 36 were in service at the time of the invasion. This was because the Polish General Command had restricted its production by the Polish company Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze [PZL], a decision that had been made in the favor of other types of aircraft. The PZL.37 was the first modern home-produced Polish medium bomber. The first PZL.37 flew in June of 1937 and was immediately recognized as a superior aircraft. Only minor modifications were required before a limited production order for the machines was given by the Polish government. One of these bombers made a sensational appearance at the 1938 Paris Air Show, resulting in orders for the PZL.37 from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. The beginning of World War II prevented delivery of any of these orders. During the brief Polish-German campaign, the PZL.37s acquitted themselves well, although their small numbers and the fact that several had been destroyed on the ground by the Luftwaffe during the early hours of the war limited their impact on the German Blitzkrieg invasion.]]>

They were high wing monoplanes of all-metal construction with valve head blisters on their engine cowlings. The first prototype flew in October of 1931. Flight testing resulted in the need for multiple revisions in both engine and airframe, so it was February of 1934 before the second prototype flew. Its performance prompted the French government to order for 28 for the French Air Force [the Armée de l'Air] and the French Naval Air Arm [l'Aéronautique]. The Lithuanian government ordered fourteen that remained in service with their tiny Air Force up to and during the early days of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Baltic States. The Dewoitine D.372s were hopelessly obsolete by that time but they labored on flown by resolute pilots. They were all destroyed either on the ground or in air combat with modern fighters.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed by Pavel Benel and Miroslav Hajn, engineers at the Czech aviation company ČKD-Praga in 1931. It flew for the first time in June of that year. The biplane, standard configuration for that era, was an immediate success and orders were placed by the Czech Air Force, which used them as elementary training aircraft at its flight schools throughout the 1930s. Pre-World War II, production of the machine was 139 units. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, the northern area of that country was divided politically into the separate state of Slovakia. Under a puppet German government, it became a German ally and its small air force was placed under Luftwaffe control. Ten of the Praga E-39s were given to the Slovakian Air Force who initially used them as trainers, but during the German invasion of the Soviet Union transferred several of them to the Soviet front where they were employed by the Slovaks as reconnaissance platforms in support of German ground forces. Other E-39s were used by the Luftwaffe in their flight training schools as elementary trainers and still others were given to the Hungarian Air Force for use in that same role.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This long-range reconnaissance aircraft had its beginnings in a famous civilian machine that achieved world attention when it flew from Tachikawa [west Tokyo] to London in just over 51 hours between April 6 to 9, 1937. This civilian plane was the Mitsubishi Ki-15 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It had been given the name Kamikaze ["Divine Wind"] by the Japanese, intending to describe its speed. Kamikaze took on another very grime meaning in the last months of World War II, when Japanese suicide aircraft, using the name Kamikaze, attacked United States naval forces in the Pacific causing great loss of American lives. Approximately 489 military versions of the civilian K-15 served with the Japanese Navy and the Army. The army designations were Ki-15-I, Ki-15-II, and the Ki-15-III. The Japanese navy versions were called C5Ml and C5M2 [modeled here]. All versions were given the Allied codename "Babs." The C5M1 began naval service in 1938 during the Sino-Japanese war where its performance was excellent. Following Japan's entry into World War II, the aircraft continued to function in the reconnaissance role, where their speed of over 300 mph was valuable and unique for a reconnaissance machine of the time.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The emerging German Luftwaffe in the mid-1930s needed a reconnaissance aircraft. The Heinkel Company responded with the He 46, a parasol-winged relative light machine that subsequently had a distinguished long career. The He 46 first flew in 1932 and He 46 Cs were equipping Luftwaffe reconnaissance units by 1936. Twenty He 46 C-1s were sent to Spain for use by the Nationalist forces. At the beginning of World War II, five units were flying He 46s and the aircraft saw service in the brief Polish campaign. As the war progressed, the He 46s were progressively replaced by the more modern Henschel Hs 126 aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. During the early phase of the war with the Soviet Union and into early 1943, the He 46 was used as a night-time "nuisance raider" using loud speakers, light bombs, and rockets to hassle Soviet troops as they slept. By the end of 1943, almost all remaining He 46 aircraft had been struck from service or were used in a training or utility role.]]>

The design was approved for production, but service use was delayed by the slow development of a suitable catapult. Only forty-four Be-4s were produced. Production was delayed by the move of the factory eastward to Omsk when advances by the German armed forces threatened the original factory near Taganrog. The KOR-2 was renamed the Be-4.]]>

By the time of the outbreak of World War II in September of 1939, all of the Ni-D.622s had been withdrawn from fighter escadrilles but were used as trainers in French flight schools. A few aircraft were employed as target tugs. After the French capitulation and German occupation of France in June of 1940, the German Luftwaffe had no interest in the Ni-D.622s and they were scraped. None survived the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft is a direct descendent of the MiG-3 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Late in 1941, a decision was made to phase out the use of the AM-35A engine in the MiG-1 and MiG-3. The MiG design team created the replacement, using much the same airframe technology as in its predecessor. The major difference between the two aircraft was that the new aircraft had a Shvetsov M-82 radial engine instead of the inline liquid-cooled engine of the MiG-3. In order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, certain changes and modifications were required in the forward section of the MiG-3's fuselage. The first prototype, the MiG I-210, flew in early 1942, but from the start its performance was not as good as the MiG-3. A follow-on prototype, the MiG I-211, with aerodynamic refinements of the engine cowling, cockpit, and tail had improved performance. However, a competing Soviet fighter, the Lavochkin La-5 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], was chosen for quantity production over the new MiG. Only a small number of MiG I-211s were built before their production was terminated in favor of the La-5. In some references published shortly after WWII, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5. It now established that the MiG-5 designation was reserved for the production version of the MiG DIS, a twin-engine prototype aircraft that did not enter production. The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. The conclusion that the MiG-5 designation was reserved for the potential production version of the twin-engine MiG DIS is supported by R. A. Belyakov in his book, MiG - Fifty Years of Secret Aircraft Design. Belyakov was a member of the MiG Design Bureau in the early 1940s and was the General Designer of the MiG Design Bureau for over two decades following the retirement of Mikoyan in 1970.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was built by the Société des Aéroplanes H. Potez and it first flew in 1925 and was derived from the Potez XXIII single seat fighter. The Potez XXV was produced in large numbers with over 4,000 being manufactured. It was used extensively by the Armée de l'Air, remaining in service until the mid 1930s. The machine was also sold to 21 foreign countries, where their careers lasted much longer. Several were in service with Ethiopia when that nation was invaded by Italy in October 1935, prior to the outbreak of World War II. As they were no match for the more modern Italian fighters, the Potez XXVs were withdrawn to the remote regions of Ethiopia, where they continued to be employed by the Ethiopian resistance forces in a reconnaissance role. Records are vague, but it appears that when WWII began in September of 1939, a few were still in operational condition. As the war progressed, the lack of maintenance along with a shortage of parts and pilots gradually grounded the tiny "Ethiopian Air Force."]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and manufactured by the Letov company in Prague. It first flew in 1934 and began equipping the Czech Air Force the following year. The machine was made in two versions—with wheeled undercarriage for land use and with floats for water operations [the "V" variant modeled here]. Although Czechoslovakia was a land locked nation, the float variant flew off lakes and rivers. The historical records of Czechoslovakian aircraft of the 1930s and of World War II are meager, so not a great deal is known about this machine or its operational career except that it functioned as a reconnaissance aircraft for the Czech Air Force during the mid and late 1930s and in that same role during the early months of World War II, when the Czech Air Force was under German control following its occupation of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939. The Letov Š.328's combat record, is vague but it appears that a few of the land variants may have been operational during the Spanish Civil War and that the Germans handed over numbers of these machines to their allies, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, who used them operationally. It is known that some of the Slovakian aircraft were seized by Slovak insurgents and actually flown against the Germans in late 1944.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This bomber was derived from the Ilyushin DB-3 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The early DB-3B suffered from lack of adequate defensive armament, having only three rifle-caliber machine guns. Following the Soviet invasion of Finland and the ensuing Winter War of 1939-1940, the DB-3s were badly mauled by the Finnish fighter force of old obsolete British Bristol Bulldogs, British Gloster Gladiators, and Dutch Fokker XXI fighters [all modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It became evident that modifications were required to the DB-3. In 1940, a modernized variant, the DB-3F, appeared with lengthened nose, more armor, increased bomb load, and improved aerodynamics. In 1942, in conformity with changed Soviet practice, the designation became Il-4 (denoting the designer, Sergey Vladimirovich Ilyushin). The Il-4 [Allied code-named "Bob"] was to become one of the best medium bombers of World War II. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the factories manufacturing the new Il-4s were moved eastward out of harms way to Siberia, where their production resumed. The shortage of strategic materials prompted the substitution of wood in much of the new variant's construction. The Il-4 performed extremely well not only as a bomber for the Red Army but also with the Soviet naval services, functioning in the roles of mine laying and torpedo launching. The naval variant was capable of carrying a 2,040-pound torpedo beneath its fuselage. Among the Il-4s many exploits was the fact that it was the first Soviet aircraft to bomb Berlin from the east on August 8, 1941. Production of the Il-4 ended in 1944 although the machine remained in service with the Soviet Air Force until well after the war.]]>

<![CDATA[This machine was the immediate successor to the Martin 167 Maryland bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Some Martin 167 Maryland aircraft did serve Great Britain, but they were the residual from an order for these machines placed by France before its capitulation to Germany in June of 1940. With the collapse of France, the remaining units of the undelivered French order were diverted to the British Royal Air Force, which in 1940 was in desperate need of military aircraft. The British Royal Air Force did nor purchase more than the residual of the original French order since they did not like the 167's very thin fuselage, which denied direct communication between crew members. The British were otherwise impressed with the 167's performance and requested the Glenn L. Martin Company to build an upgraded and larger version of the 167. Martin's new light bomber, to be named "Baltimore" after the location of the Martin plant near that city, made its first flight on June 14, 1941. Production aircraft began to arrive in England in October of 1942. During the entire production run at its Middle River, Maryland plant, the Glenn L. Martin Company built and delivered to the British Royal Air Force a total of 1,575 Martin 187 Baltimores. They provided excellent and reliable service to the British in North Africa, Sicily, the Mediterranean, and Italy throughout the entire duration of the war. The United States never employed the Martin 187 Baltimore.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was a member of the P-39 family of machines manufactured by the Bell Company of Buffalo, New York. Like the P-39, the P-63 engine is mounted behind the pilot and the propeller is driven by a long shaft. The design approach allows a thinner, streamlined nose and improved pilot visibility. The P-63 is larger than the P-39 and has a more powerful Allison engine and better aerodynamics. It differs from the P-39 by being designed more as a ground attack aircraft than as a fighter. The machine first flew in December 1942. It performed well in the ground attack role but, for inexplicable reasons, the United States Army Air Force never used the P-63 in combat. In fact, of the 3,303 P-63s built, 2,241 were shipped to the Soviet Union, where they had an excellent career. Some 300 aircraft were sent to Free French units. Thirty-two aircraft were modified by the United States Army Air Force with external armor plate and were used as gunnery targets, employing a system that activated red wing lights when the gunner hit the P-63 with special shattering bullets. Designated the RP-63C, these Kingcobra "targets" came to be called "flying pinball machines" —a not very distinguished role for a good aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Loire 46 was an improved modification of two previous Loire fighters—the Loire 43 and 45. Although improved, it resembled the earlier machines retaining their gull mono-wing configuration, open cockpit, and fixed landing gear. The first of five prototype Loire 46s flew in September 1934. It demonstrated excellent handling characteristics and 60 production aircraft were ordered by the Armée de l'Air. The initial machines arrived at fighter Escadrilles in August of 1936. In September 1936, the five prototype Loire 46s were sent to the Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War. By the beginning of World War II, the Loire 46's gull wing configuration was recognized as obsolete and most of these fighters had been relegated to Armée de l'Air training schools, where they were used as advanced trainers. However, one fighter Escadrille was still equipped with the Loire 46 during the early weeks of the war. Their performance against modern German fighters was predictable. The prototype of this model was attached to a fighter pilot training school.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Seaplanes and floatplanes dominate the Beriev family of aircraft. In the 1930s, the design bureau was tasked to design two reconnaissance aircraft. The Beriev KOR-1 was to be carried aboard medium cruisers and was to be capable of catapult launching. The slightly larger Beriev KOR-2 was developed to support heavy cruisers and battleships. KOR stood for "korabel'nyi" or "shipborne." In January 1941, the Beriev KOR-1 was renamed after the designer, Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev, and became the Be-2, while the Beriev KOR-2 became the Be-4. The KOR-1 was designed and built as a floatplane for the Soviet Navy and it was also fitted with wheel undercarriage for the Red Army. Both versions were assigned reconnaissance roles. The floatplane version [modeled here] became the standard shipboard catapult observation aircraft for Soviet cruisers in the late 1930s, and continued in that role through the early months of World War II. The land-based version [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was also used in the observation and reconnaissance role before more modern machines became available as the war progressed. Both versions were built in limited numbers and were retired or lost in combat or operations early in the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In the mid-1930s, the Royal Navy desperately needed a new high-performance modern fighter to replace its current biplane carrier fighters. The practice of the Fairey Company at that time dictated that the aircraft have a two-man crew, the second crewman needed to handle the new sophisticated navigation equipment that was emerging. The addition of the second crewman and the associated weight and size that went with his presence imposed a performance penalty. The Fairey Fulmar was, nonetheless, designed along these lines and first flew on January 13, 1937. The first production Fulmars were delivered to the Fleet Air Arm in June 1940, nine months after the start of World War II. The assignment was to No. 806 Squadron embarked on the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, where they replaced Blackburn Skuas and Rocs [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Aboard HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious, the Fulmars saw their first action defending convoys to Malta against German and Italian attack. Over its career, the Fulmar was modified into multiple variants, including a night fighter used against Italian night bombers attacking British shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. A weakness of the Fulmar Mk I was its lack of rear firing armament, making it vulnerable to rear attack. A rearward-firing gun was installed in some of the Fulmar Mk IIs. Overall, both the Fulmar Mk I and Mk II were only moderately successful. Starting in 1943, they were gradually replaced in shipboard service by the Fairey Firefly [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. All Fulmars had been retired by the war's end. One surviving specimen is on permanent display at the British Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, England. The following data are for the Fulmar Mk I.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This bomber was designed by Sergey Vladimirovich Ilyushin, founder of the aircraft firm bearing his name. It was built in the mid 1930s as a medium traditional bomber and a torpedo bomber. The machine bears a definite resemblance to the Soviet Tupolev SB-2 bomber, which had been put into production some years prior to the DB-3. The DB-3 fuselage was slightly longer than the Tupolev, but the biggest difference was that the liquid-cooled inline engines of the Tupolev were replaced by air-cooled radial engines in the DB-3. The Soviets used modified DB-3s for various record attempts. An overloaded DB-3 with added fuel tanks flew 4,700 miles in 24 hours and 36 minutes. Foreign countries, including Finland and the Republic of China, impressed by the aircraft performance, purchased the DB-3. The Soviet DB-3s were deployed in the area of the Baltic Sea as torpedo bombers and marine mine layers during the early weeks following the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The final version of the DB-3 family was the DB-3F. Unlike the earlier variants, the DB-3F has a streamlined nose. This aircraft was redesignated the Il-4 in March of 1942, and over 5,200 Il-4 aircraft were built [a model of the Il-4 is included in this collection].The DB-3M prototype of this model was functioning in the maritime surveillance role. The camouflage of the machine is unusual. Most Soviet aircraft of World War II were painted in an overall solid dark green on their upper surfaces and a sky blue on their under surfaces. This DB-3 is a rare exception with a scheme of alternate gray and white irregular spots on a field of solid light gray.]]>

<![CDATA[The Fairchild Aircraft Corporation of Hagerstown, Maryland, originally manufactured this aircraft. In 1939, the United States Army Air Force evaluated the machine comparing it to the Army's current primary trainer, the Stearman biplane [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Fairchild aircraft was found to be very acceptable and orders were placed. The machine was a low-wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear and was of mixed wood, steel tube, and fabric construction. The initial aircraft, dubbed the PT-19, underwent several modifications over the next several months. With Britain and its Commonwealth Nations then at war, the Canadian company, Fleet Aircraft, began building the Fairchild machine under license assigning them the designation "P-26 Cornell." As originally built, these machines all had an open cockpit for both student and instructor, but given the much colder weather in Canada, the Fleet variant was given an enclosed canopy with heating. Over the duration of World War II, Fleet built 1,057 of these machines and Fairchild built another 670 for export to Britain and Canada under the Lend-Lease program. These numbers do not include those built in the United States for the U.S. military. Overall, the Fairchild trainer proved to be a fine aircraft.]]>

<![CDATA[This was the only World War II operational military aircraft entirely designed and built in Belgium. It was a reconnaissance machine with the capability of light support of ground troops. Designed by the aviation company Renard in the early 1930s, it entered service with the Belgian Air Force in 1936. It was an aircraft with "V" bracing of its high placed single wing. Built of mixed construction, its frame was of welded steel tubing with metal sheet covering of the forward fuselage and fabric covering of the remainder of the airframe. Its wing bracing was conjoined with its fixed under carriage struts. Only a few were produced prior to the outbreak of World War II. The R-31 was hopelessly obsolete, and those that were not destroyed on the ground in the early hours of the German Blitzkrieg invasion of Belgium in May of 1940 were ravaged by German fighters as they bravely attempted to gather information on the German invasion. None apparently functioned as ground support aircraft during the brief Belgian Army resistance. Following the German occupation of Belgium, the Luftwaffe had no interest in the machines and those that had survived the initial onslaught were unused or were destroyed. Overall, these machines had no significant impact on the war although they were briefly involved.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This large floatplane first flew in 1932. With its biplane configuration, open cockpits, extensive wire bracing and wooden propellers, it resembled a World War I rather than a World War II machine. It was the product of Heinkel design engineer Reinhold Mewes. The aircraft were of mixed metal and fabric covering over a welded steel tube frame. The He 59s served in the roles of marine reconnaissance [He 59 B-2], air-sea rescue [He 59 C-2], and a training aircraft for pilots, radio operators, and navigators [He 59 D-1] throughout the mid and late 1930s. They were obsolete for combat use by the outbreak of World War II. However, they saw continuing service in air-sea rescue well into the war and many downed German pilots owed their lives to these large biplanes. A few He 59s remained in the reconnaissance role in the eastern Baltic during the early months of the war. The slow speed and large size of the He 59s made them easy targets for enemy fighters, thus confining their use to regions where such fighter opposition was minimal or lacking. The prototype of this model was deployed in the air-sea rescue role in the Aegean Sea.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This three-engine transport was designed and first flown in the 1920s. It was derivative of the Fokker F.VII, an experimental high-wing monoplane with a single engine. The F.VIIA/3m prototype had one nose-mounted engine and two wing-mounted engines. The fuselage was constructed of steel tube covered with fabric. A plywood cabin floor supported wicker cane seats. Numbers of these machines were sold to the world's airlines where they established flight records. The prototype F.VIIA/3m was purchased by Edsel Ford and donated to Richard E. Byrd and Floyd Bennet for their flight to the North Pole on May 9, 1926. Amelia Earhart, as a passenger in a F.VIIA/3m, was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. The Fokker F.VIIB/3m was slightly larger than the F.VIIA; had more powerful engines, and is the aircraft modeled here. The aircraft were popularly known as the Fokker Trimotors. The American Ford Trimotor and the German Junkers Ju 52 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] were somewhat similar in their design and external appearance to the Fokker F.VII. Although the Fokker Trimotors were obsolete and beyond their time when World War II broke out, several of these machine were still serving with the Royal Netherlands Air Force as passenger transports. The fate of these machines is obscure following the German occupation of the Netherlands. Apparently, the Germans had no use for them and they appear to have been scraped.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed for short takeoff and landing [STOL] operation by the Stinson Company in 1935 and designated as the Stinson Model 74. Militarized versions of the aircraft were initially designated the O-49, O-49A, and the O-49B, where the "O" stood for "Observation." Changes in the military naming system resulted in the replacement of the "O" designation with "L" for "Liaison" and the aircraft became the L-1. The versatile aircraft could be fitted with skis for snow operation or floats for water takeoff and landings. The aircraft performance was suitable for towing training gliders, reconnaissance, artillery support, and general utility roles. The aircraft was used as an air ambulance, where its rear seat was removed and a stretcher inserted. Perhaps its most important role was in the interdiction of espionage agents into German occupied Europe. Its wings had slots on the leading edges, giving great lift allowing the aircraft to use very short fields, a feature much like its German counterpart the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Vultee L-1's cabin was widely glazed with protruding window bulges on both sides and a fully glazed roof that give the two man crew excellent all around vision when the machine was in the reconnaissance role. Vigilants were commonly known as Stinson L-1s, but after Vultee purchased the Stinson Company just prior to the start of WWII, the aircraft were occasionally called the Vultee L-1s and Vultee L-1As. Although manufactured in America, over a third of the 324 aircraft produced were sent to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program where the Royal Air Force gave them the name Vigilant Mk 1 for the L-1 and Vigilant Mk II for the L-1A. The prototype of this model was used in the spy interdiction role. The following data are for the Stinson L-1A. Performance of the Stinson L-1 is similar, although the L-1 is approximately 18 inches shorter and used the 275 hp Wright Cyclone R-1300 engine.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft is the seaplane variant of the famous Japanese Zero fighter. Following the Japanese occupation of dozens of islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, there became a need for fighter protection of these new holdings from long-range Allied bomber attacks. Many of these islands had no landing fields and were too small, or the terrain was not suitable for airfield construction. The Japanese determined that a seaplane fighter that could operate from the lagoons of these islands was needed. The solution was to place floats on their highly successful Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The result was quite satisfactory. Even with its large central float and out-rigger floats, the A6M2-N [Allied code-named "Rufe"] had nearly the same excellent performance as its parent land-based Zero. A total of 327 of these seaplane fighters were built. The aircraft modeled was deployed on one the Japanese Army's small aircraft carriers. Surprisingly, the Army had its own aircraft carriers, which were independent of the Japanese Imperial Navy.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was another in the long line of Dornier flying boats. Of that linage, the Do 26 has to be considered aerodynamically the cleanest. It was developed for trans-Atlantic mail service, but with the outbreak of World War II, Do 26s only made 18 such trips across the South Atlantic. The machine had an interesting configuration different from other previous Dornier flying boats. It was all-metal and had four engines—two in a common housing arranged in a push-pull fashion positioned on top of both inverted gull shaped wings. The inverted gull shape raised the propeller arch above the water spray during take-off and landing. Less than a dozen of these sleek flying boats were constructed. They were used extensively in the Norwegian campaign where they sustained significant losses to British fighters. The three machines that survived that campaign were employed in communications work until a lack of spare parts forced the Do 26's final retirement. The Do 26 had one of the longest operational ranges of any aircraft of World War II.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed by Heinkel to replace the older Heinkel He 60 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The He 114 emerged as a different looking biplane with its lower wing being of very short span and connected to the upper wing by V shaped struts. The He 114 had more conventional two-step floats. The first prototype flew in 1936 and revealed numerous weaknesses, particularly, it had poor water and flying stability. Multiple remedies and redesign of fuselage, wings, and floats were undertaken with some improvement, but the He 114 never achieved the performance of the machine it was intended to replace, the He 60, nor of the other naval reconnaissance aircraft that eventually came to replace [such as the Arado Ar 196, modeled elsewhere in this collection]. One of the intended roles for the He 114 was reconnaissance duties on Germany's battleships and cruisers, but catapult trails revealed that the machine was not suitable for this type of operation. The He 114s were regarded by the German military as unimportant machines and they saw only limited use, mainly in the Baltic Sea area during the German occupation if that region. Some were sent to Romania where their career was not documented.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This quite large biplane looks much like a World War I holdover. It was built in response to a German Air Ministry specification for a reconnaissance aircraft. It first flew in 1932. The fuselage was of welded steel tubular frame covered with light metal sheet in the forward section and fabric in the rear. The wings were of wooden frame with fabric covering. The machine was one of the main aircraft of the emerging Luftwaffe in the early years of its rebirth and served in its flight schools up through the early days of World War II. Numbers of these machines flew with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Nationalists. During World War II, a few of these obviously obsolete machines were employed on the Soviet front in the role of nuisance night raiders. Equipped with loud speakers, light bombs, and rockets, the He 45s would over fly Soviet troops disrupting their sleep and hopefully causing morale disruption. It is unclear just how effective this scheme proved to be. By the spring of 1943, almost all He 45s had been fully retired. A few He 45s were sent to Bulgaria for training use.]]>

The original production run was for civilian use, but with the gathering European War fifteen were diverted for United States military use. A second batch were exclusively manufactured for the Navy and the Coast Guard. The Army Air Force designated the machines OA-14s, the Navy and Coast Guard J4F. Numbers of these aircraft were shipped to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease Act where they were called "Goslings." Widgeons remained in civilian service for many years after the war in several countries about the world.]]>

<![CDATA[In 1931, the Boeing Company made a proposal to the United States Army for a new small monoplane fighter. Construction of the first prototype began in January of 1932. The machine made its maiden flight on March 20 of that year and it was subsequently delivered to Wright Field for evaluation. Trials were successful and Boeing entered into contracts for production of the new fighter. By the time of the entry of the United States into World War II, the majority of these machines had been retired or relegated to training duties. However, a few P-26s remained with fighter units overseas, including in Hawaii, where the machines were still in service at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The aircraft was unoffically named the "Peashooter" because of its distinctive tube gun-sight. The P-26 was never involved in combat with enemy aircraft and all were withdrawn from service in favor of more modern fighters by late 1942, but P-26's flown by the Chinese in 1937 successfully destroyed several Japanese bombers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed by Alexander Kartveli, chief design engineer of the Seversky Company. It was first built as a civilian racing airplane. In fact, it was flown in races in the early 1930s by Alexander P. de Seversky whose company actually manufactured the machine. Its high speed and performance made it a candidate for the role of military fighter. In June of 1936, an order for 77 of the fighter versions was placed by the United States Army Air Corps. The new P-35 was delivered to the Army's Wright field in Dayton, Ohio, where it underwent testing. It was well received. The P-35 equipped fighter squadrons of the U.S. Army Air Corps into the late 1930s, when they began to be replaced by Curtiss P-40s [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. By the time of the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, most Army Air Force fighter units were no longer flying the P-35. Fighter squadrons in the Philippines were still equipped with the machines. In combat with Japanese fighters, it became obvious that the P-35 was unstable, under armed and lacked proper armor protection for its pilot and lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. The P-35 faired very poorly against the Japanese aircraft. Those P-35s that had not been destroyed were retired by late 1941. However, the P-35 is noteworthy in aviation history for another reason—the Seversky Aviation Company became the Republic Aviation Company, and it is this latter company that designed and produced the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The P-35 was, in point of fact, the predecessor of one of World War II's greatest fighters and much of the P-47's design originated with the P-35.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft could be considered a transition machine between the Seversky P-35 and the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt [both modeled elsewhere in this collection]. All three of these fighters had the same design engineer: Alexander Kartveli. In October of 1939, the Seversky Company changed its name to Republic Aviation Company, so the P-43, which began its life under Seversky and left the production lines under Republic, could be called either manufacturer's product, although "Republic" is more commonly used in referring to the P-43 fighter. The prototype P-43 was the last Seversky P-35 converted to the Republic XP-41 by adding a turbo supercarger and other improvements. The YP-43 was a continuation of this development with lower cockpit, improved landing gear and a newer version of the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine. After test flights, 272 P-43s were purchased by the Unites States Army Air Force and were deployed with pursuit groups. Their performance left much to be desired and their careers with the U.S. Army were very brief. They were largely replaced by Curtiss P-40 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. No P-43 saw any action during World War II with an American combat unit. About 180 were shipped to China, where the Nationalist forces used them against the Japanese. It is one of these Chinese P-43s that is modeled here. Overall, the P-43 was not a successful fighter. Its main place in history is that of the immediate predecessor of the famous P-47 Thunderbolt.]]>

<![CDATA[The Regia Aeronautica requested a new tactical bomber to be used in the ground support role in the mid 1930s. The Italian aircraft firm Societá Italiana Ernesto Breda designed the Ba.88 in response to the specification. It was a twin-engine high-performance machine that appeared on paper to be a very formidable weapon. However, as was often the case with new military aircraft, expectations exceeded reality. While the machine's performance was satisfactory when empty, when loaded and armed it proved to be thoroughly inadequate. Despite its faults, the machine went into production in the spring of 1937 and a total of 147 were manufactured. After the Italian entry into World War II, the Ba.88s were sent to North Africa to support Italian forces. Their operational performance was so poor and their loss ratios to British fighters was so high that they were taken back to Italy, where they ended their wartime careers parked on airfields as decoys to deceive enemy reconnaissance planes.]]>

<![CDATA[This is the smallest of all the aircraft modeled in this collection—tiny in size when compared to all other World War II trainers. It was used after the completion of a young Soviet pilot's primary and intermediary flight training to teach him gunnery. The wings of the trainer had six rifle caliber machine guns mounted on them, one on top and two beneath each wing. Using tracer ammunition, the student pilot would fire at towed drones to practice his marksmanship. The prototype of this trainer was operating in a winter climate with winter camouflage and on an undercarriage of skis. Flying in an open cockpit under such circumstances must have been a real thrill. World War II aviation historical sources give very little information about this little machine or its career.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Junkers Ju 52/3m [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was one of the most successful military transports of World War II. It was also the backbone of the Luftwaffe transport service. Despite the success of the Ju 52, Junkers looked to design its successor in the spring of 1942. Like the Ju 52 before it, the Ju 352 was to have three engines. Even by this early stage of the war, aluminum and its alloys were in short supply in Germany, leading Junkers engineers to design the new transport using mainly wood. The machine was equipped with a hydraulically powered rear-loading ramp for rapid loading and unloading. The Ju 352 made its first flight on October 1, 1943, and production aircraft were beginning to be delivered to the Luftwaffe in April of 1944. The Ju 352s served in several different transport roles. They proved to be sturdy and reliable and were worthy successors to the famous Ju 52s. However, in the summer of 1944 as the war situation worsened for the Germans, and their aircraft production shifted to fighters, Ju 352 manufacture ceased. Only two Ju 352s are known to have survived the war. One was captured intact by the British, who flew it back to England for testing. The other emerged in Czechoslovakia after the war, where it was rebuilt and presented to Joseph Stalin as a gift.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1936, Pan American Airways placed an order for six Model 314s entering service on the North Atlantic route on May 9, 1939. Six addtional 314s were delivered by January 1942 as 314As and five of the original were upgraded to 314A standards. Three of these were sold to BOAC and were operated on transatlantic service. The remaining nine were drafted into military service. Four of these were loaned back to Pan Am. At the time of its entry into service in June of 1939, the Boeing 314 was a marvel and the largest and most luxurious production aircraft of its day. It was a virtual flying hotel. Its daytime seats made into Pullman-type beds for sleeping at night. It had a lounge and dinning room. Its food, prepared on board, was renown. It even had a full suite in the rear of the passenger cabin. Boeing built the huge flying boat on a specification from the Pan American Airways Company as a long-range passenger airliner capable of trans-Atlantic flights. The problem with the Boeing 314 was not the machine itself; it was that only six months after it began service World War II broke out, thus essentially ending trans-oceanic passenger travel—the market for that the machine was designed. Pan American continued using the aircraft on its South Pacific routes until the United States entered the war in December of 1941. One 314, caught by the war in the South Pacific, escaped by flying westward to complete a flight around the world. The Navy used the machines for trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic service largely for high officials and senior officers. The aircraft were painted in the standard Navy two-tone dark blue and light blue on their upper surfaces and white on undersurfaces. They did not have the usual U.S. insignia on wings and fuselage but rather American flags. They retained their civilian registration and civilian Pan American flight crews. A few labored on after the war was over, but the era of the large flying boat was past and they all were retired by the 1950s. None survive today.]]>

With the outbreak of World War II, the bulk of these aircraft were taken into service by the German Luftwaffe and used as trainers, couriers, and utility aircraft. In 1940, several Si 202s were given to Slovakia, which after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia had been made into a separate German puppet state and an ally of Germany.

<history>
<![CDATA[Design of the Boeing 307 began in the late 1935 and utilized the wings tail and power plant of the B-17 bomber. However, construction of a prototype was delayed until orders were in hand in 1937. The first Model 307 flew on 31 December 1938. Although the first aircraft was lost during flight test, production was not delayed. The aircraft was the first passenger airliner with a fully pressurized internal cabin that allowed it to fly above much of the turbulent weather in its flight route. Some 307s were equipped with seating that made up into Pullman-like beds for travel at night. The aircraft was very successful and was well received by passengers. It revolutionized the concept of long-range passenger air travel. Pan American Airways purchased four S-307As using the Wright R-1820 G102A Cyclone engines, TWA purchased five SA-307Bs using Wright R-1820 G105 Cyclone engines, and Howard Hughes purchases a SB-307B powered with Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclones at a price of $315,000 each. With the entry of the United States into World War II, some of these machines were requisitioned by the United States Army Air Force Transport Command for military use and given the identification number C-75. Their routes of operation were mainly within the United States, but some of the TWA machines flew over 3,000 trans-Atlantic flights. Most were never painted in any type of camouflage but rather remained in their original polished metal finishes. The 307s also retained their original civilian registration and markings and most were flown by their pre-war civilian flight crews who had been deferred from formal military service in light of their duties flying their 307s. The Stratoliners resumed their civilian roles after the war but some of them had over 25,000 hours on their airframes and were becoming worn out. A few continued in civilian airline service until replaced by larger and more modern post-war passenger transports from the Douglas, Boeing, and Lockheed companies. A single Model 307 has been restored to flight worthy condition and is on display in the Udvar-Hazy facility of the Smithsonian national Air and Space Museum.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Stearman Aircraft Company of Wichita, Kansas, was taken over by the Boeing Company in 1929 but before then, in 1927, the Stearman firm began work as a private venture on a new biplane trainer. When it became available in 1935 as the Stearman Model 73, the United States Navy purchased 61, designating it NS-1. The United States Army Air Force then ordered a modified version, the Model 75, designating it PT-13. The aircraft were a great success and were probably the most superb trainers available at the time. As the clouds of war gathered and the U.S. military expanded, many more of these machines were ordered and put into service. Although owned by Boeing from 1929 onward, Stearman continued to operate as the Stearman, a subsidiary of Boeing until 1939 when it became an operating division of the Boeing Airplane Company. However, the name Stearman stuck and they remained "Stearman" throughout their entire long career. Since they were usually painted a bright yellow and they were flown by inexperienced students, they acquired the nickname "yellow peril." Virtually all U.S. airmen who flew and fought in World War II began their primary training on this machine. By 1945, over 8,500 of these aircraft had been built in nine versions depending primarily on engines. Performance was consistent for all versions of the Model 75. The Stearman Kaydet retains a nostalgic place in history along with the British de Havilland Tiger Moth and the German Bucker trainer [both modeled elsewhere in this collection].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Lockheed company's Hudson reconnaissance bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection] had been a success in operation with the British Royal Air Force during the early months of World War II, prompting the Lockheed company to build a more advanced successor. The new aircraft was based on Lockheed's somewhat larger model 18 Lodestar civilian airliner. The new machine was produced by the company's Vega division and made its first flight on July 31, 1941.The Ventura had a wider and deeper fuselage than the Hudson and had more powerful engines, although the two were quite similar in external appearance. The wider fuselage allowed for a greater bomb load, larger fuel tanks, and more defensive armament. Like its predecessor the Hudson, the Ventura was first operational with the British Bomber Command, but was found to be unsuitable for daylight bombing and the British cancelled their remaining orders for Venturas. Those that the British already had in hand were transferred to Coastal Command for use in maritime patrol and anti-submarine duties or were given to Commonwealth Air Forces. In 1942, the United States Army Air Force ordered numbers of Venturas but also found them unsuitable for their uses. This left the aircraft's entire production available for the United States Navy, which used the Ventura with great success as a naval reconnaissance bomber that they designated the PV 1 [modeled here]. The Navy received their first Venturas in December of 1942 and flew more than 1,600 of them throughout the remainder of the war. In 1943, an upgraded variant of the Ventura was built by Lockheed and was designated the PV 2 "Harpoon." Its external appearance was almost identical to the Ventura. Both these aircraft and the original Hudson had extremely successful careers flying for the United States, Great Britain and its Commonwealth Nations. They made substantial contributions to the Allied war effort.]]>

<![CDATA[Recognizing the successful use of gliders by the Germans in their airborne invasions early in the war, the British Air Ministry determined that their forces have similar capability. In December of 1940, the Airspeed Company received a specification for a troop carrying attack glider that would have twice the capacity of the United States' Waco CG-4A Hadrian [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Fabricated of wood and subcontracted largely to British woodworking and furniture companies, the aircraft were made in sections and assembled in central factories. Although they look alike externally, there were two versions of the Horsa: the AS.51 Mk I [modeled here] and the AS.58 Mk II. The former had doors on both sides of the fuselage and was used exclusively for troops and their light equipment. The Mk II had a hinged nose that opened up for the direct loading of vehicles, guns, and heavy equipment. The Horsa gliders were towed into combat by aircraft tugs: usually Douglas DC-3s, Short Stirlings, or Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys [all three modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Although the exact number is unclear, it is estimated that over 3,700 Horsa gliders were manufactured during World War II. They saw action in the invasions of Sicily, Southern France, Normandy, Arnhem, and the Rhine River Crossings.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was derived from the Junkers Ju 188 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and it resembled its predecessor with the same bulbous glazed nose and thin fuselage. The Ju 388 project began with a Luftwaffe specification for a high-speed and high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Modifications of the Ju 188 airframe, needed to produce the new Ju 388, were only modest thus allowing for a rapid design of the new machine. Given the desperate need to counter the heavy night bombing of Germany's cities and industry by the British, another high priority was a new high-performance night fighter. To address this need, several of the new Ju 388s were equipped with the FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar, creating the Ju 388J night fighter. The antlers of the machine's radar system can be seen extending from the nose of this model of the Ju 388J prototype. The Ju 388J was also powerfully armed with four nose cannon. Only three of the Junkers Ju 388J night fighter variants were completed before the war's end and none were ever attached to an operational night fighter unit. Ju 388s of other types were deployed to reconnaissance units of the Luftwaffe but less than 20 Ju 388s of all variants were manufactured before German capitulation.]]>

It fulfilled a specification issued by the Italian Air Ministry for a low cost training machine to be used as a primary trainer for future pilots of the Regia Aeronautica. Its design was unique for the time when most primary trainers were biplanes with the pupil and the instructor seating in tandem in the fuselage cockpits. The A.V.I.A. FL 3 was different with a low mono-wing configuration and with the student and the instructor sitting side by side, thus making instruction and communication easier. In all, 355 were built, 20 of which served with the Croatian Air Force. During the course of World War II, the Germans seized 250 as trainers for the Luftwaffe. Overall, it was a very successful aircraft. Production was resumed by the Lombardi Company following World War II, using an 85 hp Continental flat four air-cooled piston engine.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1940, the United States Army Air Force recognized the need for a multi-engine trainer to begin the training of young pilots in view of the on-going war in Europe. The Army already had the Cessna T-50 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The T-50 was used for the initial transition of a new pilot from a single engine to a twin-engine aircraft. An advanced machine was required to teach pilots the skills needed in flying a high-performance multi-engine medium bomber such as the B-25 and the B-26 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] that were coming into service with the Army Air Force. The solution was the Model 25, an aircraft already manufactured by Curtiss. It was a high performance all-metal machine with retractable landing gear. Army testing proved satisfactory and production of the machine, now designated the AT-9, begun. A total of 491 AT-9s were produced followed by 300 AT-9As. Although the AT-9 originally was called the "Fledging," the "Jeep" replaced that nickname. The Jeep remained in the training role for a short time, being replaced by more modern and suitable trainers as the war progressed. Production of the AT-9 ended in February 1943.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was the largest flying boat to achieve operational status during World War II. Dr. Richard Vogt and Herr R. Schubert, Blohm & Voss engineers, designed the BV 222 to meet a 1937 request from the German airline Lufthansa for a long-range passenger transport. The development of this large and complicated aircraft was an engineering undertaking requiring almost three years. The first BV 222 flew on September 7, 1940. By this time, the realities of war ruled out long-range passenger travel but the obvious military value of the machine became immediately evident and all further production was diverted in that direction. The aircraft's huge unobstructed floor area within its fuselage made it ideal as a transport for all manner of war materials and BV 222s were employed in this role supplying German forces in the Mediterranean theater from Greece to Libya. Other of these aircraft were used in the long-range reconnaissance role flying sorties into the Atlantic and as far as the Artic Ocean. They were used to communicate with German submarines in the identification of Allied shipping. The use of diesel engines permitted refueling at sea by U-boats. While excellent aircraft with good performance, their greatest weakness was their vulnerability to Allied fighters. Many were destroyed during the conflict but several of these huge machines survived World War II and after German surrender were extensively evaluated by the Allied nations.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Junkers Ju 290 emerged from a long and circuitous evolution. It began in the early 1930s with an attempt by the Junkers Company to developed a large long-range four-engine bomber, the Ju 89 "Ural Bomber." However, German leaders did not believe in the concept of large heavy bombers, placing their belief in the concept of smaller and cheaper two-engine medium bomber types. In an effort to salvage the design efforts expended in the aborted Ju 89, Junkers converted the machine into a civilian transport, the Ju 90, which flew in early 1938. Numbers of these Ju 90s were sold to several airlines for passenger transports. With the advent of World War II, the Luftwaffe recognized the need for a long range aircraft for transport and reconnaissance duties and claimed the ongoing production of these large machines for the Luftwaffe. They were provided with armament, modified for military use, and named Junkers Ju 290s. They were among the largest aircraft in Luftwaffe service and began flying in August of 1942. They were used in the roles of long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and heavy transports. In the latter role, they assisted in the attempt to supply German troops in the Battle of Stalingrad. The Ju 290A-5 variant [modeled here], equipped with new FuG 200 Hohentwiel radar, flew vast areas of the Atlantic Ocean searching for Allied convoys subsequently reporting the convoy's position to German U-boats. Although equipped for the bombing of any convoys it might discover, the Ju 290 was poorly suited for this role. The Ju 290 was best used as a transport, the role for that it was originally designed. Over 50 aircraft were built. Several aircraft survived the war, two going to England, and one going to Spain. A Ju 290 was captured intact by American forces and subjected to extensive post-war evaluation.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was one of the first successful military helicopters. Using outrigger-mounted twin rotors, it looked cumbersome, but its operational capacity was excellent and it was used in multiple roles: reconnaissance, light transport, rescue, and anti-submarine patrol. Equipment varied depending upon the aircraft's mission. This included machine guns, rescue winch with cradle, cameras, and auxiliary fuel tanks. Prior to the war's end, 39 had been built largely at a Bremen, Germany, factory. Production was halted by severe damage to that facility by Allied bombing. These helicopters were extensively evaluated by the United States and Great Britain after the war's end. The flight of the Fa 223 to England for evaluation was the first helicopter crossing of the English Channel. Post-war France manufactured the Fa 223 designating them the Sud Est SE 3000. Clearly, the Fa 223 helped lead the way for the development of all subsequent military helicopters.]]>

<![CDATA[The Japanese Army trained their fighter pilots and the pilots of their other high performance aircraft in this aircraft. Young Japanese pilots who had successfully completed their basic elementary training flew the Ki-55 to gain experience in a machine with properties more closely resembling those of the fast warplanes they would be flying. The Ki-55 had fixed landing gear and was a derivative of the Ki-36, an army co-operation aircraft. Both the Ki-36 and the Ki-55 were given the Allied code name of "Ida." The Ki-55 was of all-metal construction with a large glazed cockpit with pupil and instructor seated in tandem. The overall appearance and purpose were very similar to the United States' North American AT-6 "Texan" trainer [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Ki-55 was widely employed by the Japanese throughout World War II. While the standard training aircraft were unarmed, near the end of the war some of the Ki-55s were used as suicide aircraft after modification to carry a 250- or 500-kg (550- or 1,100-pound) bomb.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was one of the most remarkable machines built during World War II and certainly one of the most bizarre in appearance. The German High Command had developed and put into service the huge cargo transport glider, the Messerschmitt Me 321 Gigant [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Its cavernous interior could carry large quantities of war materials and troops. To pull this giant glider the Heinkel Company created a new aircraft—the He 111 Z [Z denoting Zwilling, "Twin"]. The new glider tug was created by joining two He 111 H-6s with a common central wing upon which was mounted a fifth engine. It had a crew of seven. The pilot and three crew were housed in the port fuselage, the remaining three in the starboard fuselage. Tests with the new tug were astounding. The He 111 Z could pull a fully loaded Gigant at a sustained speed of 140 mph. The concept, that had seemed impossible to many, was proven to be operational. Many flights of Me 321s were carried out lifting supplies to German troops on the Soviet front. The prototype of this model of the He 111 Z is painted in white camouflage given its winter operation on the Eastern front.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The German Blitzkrieg concept of war, which achieved such great success in the invasions of Poland, the Low Countries, and France, halted at waters edge. Crossing bodies of water, as was necessary for the planned invasion of England, was a problem as was the transport of heavy items including armor. German planners decided that they needed air transport with a cargo capacity far in excess of that available with the Junkers Ju 52 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. A glider format was selected and the German aircraft industry in October of 1940 was given just fourteen days to come up with proposals for the new transport glider. Messerschmitt submitted the wining plan—the huge Me 321 "Gigant." It had the longest wingspan of any operational aircraft of World War II, just five feet less than a modern Boeing 747-200. Constructed of welded steel tube covered by fabric and with wood flooring, it could carry over 200 fully equipped troops or large amounts of cargo including armored cars and light tanks. It rested on an under carriage that fell away after take off and it landed on skids beneath its fuselage. Towing the huge glider was problematic. First efforts employed three Me 110s [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Coordinating the simultaneous takeoff of three tugs was not easy and numerous spectacular accidents ensued. The problem was resolved, at least in part, by the development of the five-engine Heinkel 111 Z twin fuselage tug aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The He 111 Z would pull the huge glider into the air with the aid of eight hydrogen peroxide powered rockets beneath the Me 321’s wings, that gave an additional 30 seconds of much needed takeoff thrust. Once airborne, the He 111 Z could pull the Me 321 at a speed of 140 mph. After landing, getting the huge glider back onto a dolly under carriage and refitting it with fresh rockets and preparing it for a return trip was difficult. Much equipment and numerous support personnel were needed at the landing site. Given these problems, a decision was made to motorize the huge Me 321 making it independent of tugs and making its operations easier. The six engine motorized variant of the Me 321 glider became the Me 323 Transport [modeled elsewhere].]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The history of the Swordfish is also given in the discussion of the other Fairey Swordfish in this collection [Swordfish of No. 824 Squadron]. The Fairey Swordfish was involved in many battles during the European phase of World War II. Despite its obsolete appearance, the machine could operate from the deck of a pitching aircraft carrier when no other torpedo bomber or any other carrier-based machine could do so. Perhaps the Swordfish's first major engagement was on the night of November 11, 1940, when 21 Fairey Swordfish from No. 820 Squadron [modeled here] and other Swordfish squadrons conducted a night attack on the Italian Mediterranean Fleet, which was at anchor in the harbor of Taranto, Italy. The attack changed the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean for the remainder of the war in favor of the British. The Swordfish in that single night attack damaged or sunk three Italian battleships, one cruiser, two destroyers, and several auxiliary vessels. Some military historians feel that this attack was studied by the Japanese and became the prototype for their attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. Another epic engagement occurred when Swordfish of No. 820 Squadron [modeled here] flying from the Aircraft Carrier HMS Ark Royal torpedoed the German battleship Bismarck damaging its rudder and steering, thus slowing the giant warship and allowing a strong British surface force lead by the battleships HMS King George V and HMS Rodney to engage the Bismarck and sink her. Without the successful Swordfish torpedo attack, the Bismarck might have escaped the British task force. The Swordfish functioned not only as a torpedo bomber but also as a reconnaissance aircraft catapulted from capital ships, a marine mine layer, an anti-submarine platform, a trainer, and a target tug. A grand total of 2,391 Swordfish were manufactured from 1934 until the end of World War II. The final Swordfish Squadron [No. 836] was officially disbanded on May 21, 1945, two weeks after the end of the European war. Thus, came the end of an era.]]>

<![CDATA[The Douglas C-47 was the most important Allied transport of World War II. It was the military version of the civilian DC-3. The Douglas Aircraft Company developed the Douglas DC-1, a twin-engine civilian all-metal transport in the early 1930s and promptly followed it with an enlarged and improved modification—the DC-2 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Next in the Douglas family of passenger aircraft was the DC-3, which first flew on December 15, 1935. It was an early Christmas present for Douglas, since the production of this aircraft over the next decade totaled nearly 13,000 machines and was the bread and butter of all Douglas manufacturing. The DC-3 revolutionized civilian passenger air travel within a few short years after its introduction. Every airline in the world wanted the new comfortable machine for its fleet. The military version of the DC-3 was essentially the same as the civilian, except for changes in the internal arrangements of the cabin and the removal of its Wright-Cyclone engines in favor of Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 twin wasp power plants. The United States Army Air Corps termed the DC-3 the "C-47," the U.S. Navy the "R4D," the British Royal Air Force the "Dakota," the Russians the "Lisunov Li-2," and the U.S. and British soldiers and airmen the "Gooney Bird," but the most appropriate word could have been "ubiquitous." Indeed, this machine was operational in every theater of World War II flying for just about every Allied Air Force in an unbelievable array of roles: passenger transport, paratrooper drop aircraft, cargo transport, glider tug, reconnaissance platform, communication platform, air ambulance, and other utility tasks. It has been reported that more than one Allied senior military leader said that the war could not have been won without this aircraft. The machines remained in active military and civilian service for years after the war and some are still flying today in the 21st Century—about 70 years after their manufacture.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In an effort to extend the area the German Type IX long-range submarines could locate allied shipping, the German Navy considered employing a small reconnaissance aircraft. The proposed aircraft would explore the seas for potential Allied shipping targets and look for impending danger from enemy warships. A shortcoming of submarines, even those with radar, was their short line of vision and the short range of radar scanning stemming from their low profile in the water. An aircraft could greatly enhance the submarines "eyes." Responding to a specification for a small submarine-based aircraft, the Arado Company designed the Ar 231. It was a small, all-metal, high-wing float seaplane that could be carried by the submarine even if the sub was submerged. The machine was stored in a waterproof tube about six and a half feet (2 m) in diameter on the deck of the submarine and could be assembled or dismantled in just 6 minutes by a trained crew. Its wing was angled at the center to allow the wing to fold against the fuselage as did its metal floats. The Ar 231 first flew on April 25, 1941, but its handling characteristics both in the air and on water were poor due to the properties of its unusual wing and airframe. Only six prototypes were built. The aircraft was never used operationally or put into production]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Early in World War II, it was agreed by the Allies that the United States would build all transport aircraft, thus freeing Great Britain to concentrate on fighters and bombers. An exception to this policy occurred in 1941 when Avro engineer Roy Chadwick designed the Avro York. The wings, tail assembly, engines, and landing gear were taken from the highly successful Avro Lancaster heavy bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and were inserted into a new square-section fuselage with a new central third fin added to the tail assembly. Yorks were produced in three variants: passenger, all-freight, and passenger/freight. The first machine was delivered to Royal Air Force No. 24 Squadron at Northolt, England, in March 1943. Yorks were especially fitted for Great Britain's leaders. Winston Churchill's York, called the Ascalon, was equipped as a flying conference room and flew him to Algiers. King George VI used his to visit British troops in North Africa. Other British VIPs had Yorks including Louis Mountbatten, Field Marshal Smuts and the Duke of Gloucester. Five Yorks were delivered to British Overseas Airways Corporation [BOAC] for their England-Morocco-Cairo route. Ten squadrons were eventually to fly the aircraft in RAF service. Following WWII, Yorks delivered over half of the material furnished by Great Britain in the Berlin Air Lift. They remained operational with RAF transport units until 1957, and in commercial service until 1964. A total of 257 Yorks were produced, the majority being built after the end of WWII.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built to fulfill a Japanese Imperial Navy specification for a new high performance reconnaissance machine to deploy aboard Japanese aircraft carriers. The result was the Nakajima C6N [modeled here], one of the finest reconnaissance types of World War II. It was fastest Japanese aircraft to enter operational service and had great range. The first prototype flew on May 15, 1943, but the aircraft did not enter operational service until over a year later due to continued failures of its engine. When production finally began in late 1944, four versions totaling 463 aircraft were built. By this time, Japan no longer had a significant number of aircraft carriers nor did it have enough skilled pilots to fly the high-speed, high-performance machine. As a result, most C6N aircraft [Allied code-named "Myrt"] flew from land bases until the Japanese capitulation. Its small numbers and late arrival had no impact upon the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This is an aircraft that never really found a home. It was built in the United States but spent much of its career flying for other countries and was handed around between nations like an unwanted child. The first hundred Northrop A-17s began supplying the United States Army Air Force in December of 1935. Their role was to be a light attack aircraft employed in the support of ground troops. The A-17 had fixed landing gear and a 750 hp engine, with a performance only marginally satisfactory. Despite this, 129 A-17As [with retractable gear and an 825 hp engine] were ordered from Northrop. Douglas acquired a controlling interest in the Northrop Company and Douglas completed the outstanding order. However, the U.S. Army subsequently returned most of the A-17As to Douglas as unsatisfactory. The U.S. Army retained a few in the bomber role [such as the prototype of this model], but most of the retained U.S. machines were used as trainers and utility aircraft. In 1939, the clouds of war were gathering over Europe and purchasing commissions from both Great Britain and France, desperate for military aircraft, bought numbers of the returned A-17As from Douglas. The French aircraft were in the process of delivery when France capitulated to Germany in June of 1940, so their machines were diverted to Great Britain and joined with those A-17As purchased by the British committee. The British Royal Air Force gave them to the South African Air Force, which did not like them either. Other A-17s ended up briefly with the air forces of the Netherlands and Norway before they too were overrun by Germany. A few did find a somewhat more permanent home with the air forces of Iraq and Argentina. Its itinerant career would tend to suggest the A-17A's overall performance was less than desirable. Nonetheless, it did serve in the war if only in a minor way.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1941, the United States Navy was making plans for its new 45,000-ton aircraft carriers that were to be much larger than their current carriers of the Essex class. These would eventually become the "Midway" class of carriers. To fly from these much larger carriers, the Navy wanted a new high-performance aircraft that could not only function as a fighter, but that could also carry an increased bomb load heavier than current carrier-based machines. Grumman responded with the F7F Tigercat. It was so much larger than its predecessor, that Grumman engineers gave it two engines instead of the single power plant in all of their previous naval fighters. With its two engines, slim fuselage, and tricycle landing gear, there was little resemblance between the F7F and previous Grumman fighters. The first Tigercat flew in December of 1943. So sure were the military leaders that Grumman would come up with another superb aircraft, that production orders for 500 machines had been placed before that December flight. As flight-testing progressed, it became obvious that the large high-performance machine would be difficult to operate form the decks of the Essex class carriers—all that were available at the time. This, coupled with the fact that the Navy had ample other currently operational carrier aircraft, resulted with the F7Fs being assigned primarily to the Marines for the ground support role. One of the variants of the F7F was the F7F-2N night fighter [modeled here]. It was different in that it had additional radar. The addition of the radar required the removal of the nose guns and one fuel tank. Unlike the day fighter version, the radar night fighters had a two-man crew. No F7F saw combat before the end of World War II and most of the original order was canceled after the Japanese surrender in August of 1945. F7Fs remained in service with Marine Corps units for several years after the war.]]>

<![CDATA[This machine was derived from the Kawasaki Ki-45 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It had a twin engine and slim fuselage configuration similar to its predecessor. The Ki-102 was built in response to an Imperial Army specification for a new heavy fighter for day and night use that could be used for ground attack. It was designed by Kawasaki engineer Takeo Doi, the same man who developed the Ki-46. The first prototypes flew in March of 1944 and production aircraft began equipping operational units late that same year. Their performance was outstanding, but by 1944 shortages of nearly all materials slowed the Ki-102s manufacture. The ground attack variant [modeled here] had one of the heaviest armaments of any fighter aircraft of the war. The Ki-102s arrived on the scene about the same time that American B-29s [modeled elsewhere in this collection] were bombing Japanese cities and Japanese industry almost every night. In response to this, some of the Ki-102 variants were night fighters—the Ki-102 "c" version. Different night fighting radar systems were being experimented with in Ki-102cs when the war ended. Including all of its variants, only 238 Ki-102s were built and their arrival was too late to have any impact on the war.]]>

<![CDATA[Designed with experience gained from providing aircraft to the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, the Ar-2 is a somewhat obscure aircraft of World War II. It was conceived as an attack dive bomber fitted with a dorsal turret for defensive protection against rear attack and wings that were provided with air brakes needed for its dive bombing role. Production of the aircraft began in 1940. However, this machine was over-shadowed by the Petlyakov Pe-2 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which was an aircraft of similar type and with a similar mission. The Pe-2 went into production at about the same time as the Ar-2 and the former proved to be the superior machine. Thus, only 200 Ar-2s were built before production was terminated in favor of its rival. Some Ar-2s were, however, deployed in combat during the first years of war on the Eastern Front. They performed with modest success.]]>

Despite the good performance of the aircraft, only two prototypes and ten production aircraft were built. All operational aircraft were assigned to a single operational squadron. They were used mainly as Mediterranean convoy escort fighters and as strategic reconnaissance platforms. One CR.25 was modified as a light transport and was assigned to the Italian attaché to Berlin as his personal aircraft. The machines had a relatively short career and were withdrawn from service in January 1943]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The United States Navy requested a new torpedo bomber to complement or replace its existing Grumman Avenger torpedo bombers. The Vought Company was awarded a contract to develop such a machine in April of 1940. The first prototype flew in December of 1941 and the machine was delivered to the Navy for evaluation in March of 1942. It was of mid-wing configuration, all-metal construction with retractable under carriage. The cabin was beneath a long glazed canopy housing a crew of three. The machine's torpedo was carried internally in a lower fuselage bay. Tests revealed that the new torpedo bomber had far better performance than the Grumman Avenger and the machine was ordered into production. However, Vought's production capacity was not capable of manufacturing the volume of aircraft wanted. Thus, production was transferred to Consolidated Aircraft, which was to build 1,000 of these machines in a new plant in Allentown Pennsylvania. Building of the required new plant and production problems delayed the delivery of the first production aircraft to the Navy until November of 1944. The new Sea Wolfs were undergoing familiarization trials with combat units when the war ended, thus canceling the government's contract and stopping production. None of these torpedo bombers ever saw combat. A few remained in Naval units after the war.]]>

<![CDATA[The German High Command decided in 1940 that a replacement for the ubiquitous Junkers Ju 52/3m transport was needed. To fulfill this specification, Arado designed the Ar 232, featuring a pod-and-boom fuselage with a hydraulically operated rear-loading door. The fuselage could be lowered to ease the loading and unloading of equipment. It had an unusual arrangement of eleven pairs of small wheels beneath the fuselage designed to stabilize the machine in the lowered position. This arrangement led to the aircraft being called the Tausendfüßler ["Millipede"]. The Arado 232 first flew in 1941. Many of these aircraft saw extensive service on the Eastern Front in efforts to supply the German Army. An Ar 232 was the last aircraft transport to leave the Pitomnik airfield within the shrinking perimeter of the beleaguered and surrounded German garrison before their final surrender at the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad. While intended to replace the Junkers Ju 52/3m, it never did and the older machine remained the primary German transport through the entire war.]]>

<![CDATA[The R-XIII was the last of a series of two-seat observation and liaison aircraft designed by the Plage i Laśkiewicz company from 1927 through 1935. It first flew in August 1931. In 1935, the company declared bankruptcy and was taken over by the Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów, which produced a series of transport airplanes. Production of the R-XIII was continued and 200 were built for the Polish army and 20 were built for the Polish navy. Its fuselage was of a welded metal tubular frame with fabric covering, except the forward area which had metal sheet covering. Its single parasol-type wing was of wood framing with fabric covering and the machine had a fixed landing gear. By 1939, the R-XIII equipped seven observation squadrons with others used for liaison. They suffered horrific losses during the German invasion, many falling to indiscriminate Polish ground fire. The Lublin R-XIII D was hopelessly obsolete and one can only imagine their fate if encountered by German fighters.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The United States Naval Aircraft Factory was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1918 to evaluate and test naval aircraft. With time, it also began to design and build some machines independently. The N3N modeled here was such an original type. The first N3N was manufactured at the Naval Factory in 1934. It was a primary trainer fitted with a fixed under carriage of either wheels or a central float with wing mounted out-rigger floats. The N3N was routinely painted in a bright yellow-orange color . Since it was often flown by inexperienced young pilots, its official name "Canary" was supplanted by the nickname "Yellow Peril." The machine was widely employed in United States Naval training facilities throughout the country during World War II. During and following World War II, numbers of these trainers were deployed at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Midshipman at the Academy were not given formal flight training during their tenure there, but the N3Ns were used to give midshipmen their first exposure to aviation in the hope that numbers of them would enter into formal flight training after graduation and become Navy pilots. The concept was effective and the N3Ns continued in this service until 1961, when they were finally retired. Upon their retirement the N3Ns were the last biplane aircraft in service with the United Sates military.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Lockheed’s Electra twin engine all-metal passenger aircraft was a major success as a civilian transport and had been used by aviation pioneers such as Amelia Earhart in numerous aviation record breaking flights. In fact, Amelia Earhart was lost in an Electra over the Pacific while attempting to circumnavigate the globe in the late 1930s. Lockheed felt the need to design a smaller more powerful version of the Electra, which they subsequently termed the "Electra Junior." It was intended as a feeder for large commercial airlines and as a private aircraft for the very wealthy and for corporation executives. The "Junior" first flew on June 27, 1936, and proved to be an excellent machine. Having the same power plants as the Electra and yet being smaller, it had far superior performance. The larger airlines showed no interest in the Junior, but its sales to private companies and individuals went well. An exception to airline sales was that of British Airways, which bought several Juniors. Their use of one of these machines is very interesting and is the material of which mystery adventures are made. One Junior owned by the Royal Air Force, G-AFTL, [modeled here], was employed by the British MI6 secret Service in the summer of 1939 during the months leading up to World War II. While posing as a civilian airliner and piloted by photographic expert Sidney Cotton, it made numerous flights over Nazi Germany carrying out clandestine photographic missions of German industry and military sites. The G-AFTL thus became the first Lockheed spy plane and was the forerunner of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird, the famous United States spy planes that flew decades later.]]>

<![CDATA[The Sikorsky Company had a long history of building flying boats during the late 1920s and the 1930s. The Sikorsky S-43, introduced in 1935, was an 18 passenger amphibian used by Pan American on Caribbean routes. In 1937, the U.S. Navy purchased seven as maritime reconnaissance aircraft with the designation JRS-1modeled here. They purchased an additional eight in 1938 plus two for the Marine Corps. The JRS-1 was the main naval reconnaissance aircraft throughout the remainder of that decade until it was gradually replaced by the Consolidated PBY Catalina [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. By the time of the Pearl Harbor attack and the entry of the United States into World War II, the Sikorsky JRS had been relegated to secondary roles in marine transport and air sea rescue. Despite their age, they continued to labor on during the war, but through attrition they were largely gone by the war’s end.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was designed to fulfill a 1935 request from the German Airline Lufthansa for a trans-oceanic aircraft for international mail service. Given the absence of land-based airfields at that time, the specifications called for a seaplane to operate from water. The first prototype flew in the fall of 1936 and production machines began flying for Lufthansa on trans-Atlantic routes in mid-1938. With the advent of World War II, these machines and their Lufthansa crews were absorbed into the Luftwaffe for reconnaissance service since their long range of over 3,200 miles suited them extremely well for this duty. In order to perform in this role certain modifications were made—a lengthened glazed nose with a machine gun, ports in the fuselage sides and top for machine guns and strengthened floats for operation in rough seas. Numbers of these aircraft were employed not only in marine reconnaissance roles, but also as weather observers. Others served as transports flying supplies to German forces stationed in remote Norwegian fjords. In 1942, one Ha 139 underwent special modification with the addition of a large degaussing loop that encircled the airframe similar to that used by the British on the Vickers Wellington. It is this machine that has been modeled in this collection. The aircraft’s purpose was to detect and destroy marine mines in order to clear the way for German shipping, especially in the Baltic Sea where British aircraft and submarines had laid mine fields. Wartime records are a bit unclear, but it is unlikely that this mine-detecting machine proved effective in this mission. All Ha 139s were scrapped in the last years of the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Junkers Ju 87G Stuka was the last variant of this famous dive bomber. The Junkers Ju 87G was modified as an anti-armor ground attack aircraft. It had much the same lines and appearance as did the many previous Ju 87s, since it employed the same airframe as the Ju 87D. The main difference was the very heavy armament carried by the "G" models. In 1942, trials were conducted fitting two 37 mm cannon under the wings of the Ju 87 and using it in the role of "tank killer." Each of these cannon weighed over 800 pounds. The scheme worked well and the Stuka Gs were found to be as effectives as were the Henschel Hs 129s [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which had been designed from their inception as anti-tank machines. The Ju 87G that this model replicates was one flown by the famous German aviator Hans-Ulrich Rudel who, while flying his Stukas, sank a battleship, a cruiser, a destroyer, and while on the Soviet front flew 2,530 combat sorties, in the course of which he was shot down 30 times only to fly again after each instance. Flying Ju 87Gs with the Luftwaffe on the Soviet front, Rudel was credited with personally destroying 519 Soviet tanks. No other Luftwaffe pilot even came close to achieving such a record during World War II.]]>

<![CDATA[In December of 1939, Finland was in a desperate war with invading Soviet forces. It was in serious need of fighter aircraft. The Finnish government purchased thirty Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection] from France. Finland put them into immediate service in the 1939-1940 Soviet-Finnish Winter War. By mid 1942. these M.S.406s were becoming obsolete. By this time France had capitulated to Germany and Finland had become a somewhat reluctant ally of Germany in their mutual fight against the Soviet Union. In its initial rapid occupation of the western Soviet Union, the Germans captured substantial quantities of Soviet aircraft parts and engines. Numbers of captured Klimov M-105P engines and new, more modern propellers were sent to Finland, where they were fitted to the old M.S.406 airframes. Various other German aircraft parts, including oil coolers, were sent to Finland by the Germans. These were also fitted, resulting in a vastly improved performance from these modified M.S.406s. The Finns called these modified machines "Mörkös" or "Mörkö-Moraanis." All of the Finnish M.S.406 airframes were thus converted and by the end of World War II forty-one Mörkös were in service with the Finnish Air Force. The prototype modeled here is one of the earliest conversions.]]>

<![CDATA[The Bloch MB.155 was designed to overcome the problems of its predecessor, the Bloch MB.152 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]—problems that became evident with the Bloch MB.152’s first trials. Improvements over the MB.152 included a larger fuel tank allowing for greater range, improved aerodynamics, and increased armament. The machine first flew on December 3, 1939, just 3 months after the start of World War II during that period known as "the phony war," when there was little action and before the German invasion of the low countries and France. After its trials, the machine was deemed to have great promise and was immediately put into production, but only ten had been built prior to French capitulation in June of 1940. Two of these were destroyed by German bombing. The remaining eight and several other additional machines manufactured after the French capitulation were taken in hand by the new Vichy French government. After the invasion and occupation of the Vichy French area of Southern France in November of 1942, the Germans captured and put into their service with the Luftwaffe numbers of Bloch MB.155s. The German High Command was impressed enough with these aircraft that they forced the resumption of their manufacture in French plants. No less than forty Bloch MB.155s were deployed in fighter units of the Luftwaffe during the war. Overall, it was clearly the best French manufactured fighter of the World War II, although it was built in only very small numbers.]]>

<![CDATA[The Douglas Aircraft Company flew its first all-metal passenger transport, the DC-1, on June 22, 1933. From experience learned with the DC-1, which was never marketed to civilian airlines, Douglas almost immediately began designing and producing its successor, the DC-2 [modeled here]. The "2" was sold to airlines and achieved success, but Douglas once again sought to improve the DC-2 by building the DC-3, which was destined to become probably the most famous airliner of all time and have a huge impact on World War II. The DC-2 was no longer in production by the time of the outbreak of the war, having been replaced by the DC-3, but numbers of these older machines [which the United States military called the C-32] were still in active service about the world. The aircraft modeled, a former Eastern Airlines DC-2, was serving with Australian forces in the northeast region of Australia, was based in Cairns, and was used in the support of forces fighting the Japanese in the Pacific theater of operation. While somewhat smaller and with lesser performance than the DC-3, the DC-2 looked much the same as its famous successor. The DC-2s in military service were used extensively, especially during the early years of the war. One of their most famous operations was the evacuation of American survivors from the Philippines to Australia in 1941. The U.S. military had a number of versions incorporating some DC-3 components and other modifications that operated as C-33, C-34, C-38, C-39, C-41, C-42, and R2D.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Gotha Company that manufactured German aircraft during World War I was forced to close down by the terms of the Versailles Treaty. The firm re-emerged in 1933 and its first aircraft was the Gotha Go 145 trainer. It was of all wood and fabric construction except for thin metal panels on the forward fuselage. The Go 145 first flew in February of 1934, was an immediate success, and was ordered as a trainer by the Luftwaffe. The machine was widely employed in Luftwaffe flight schools in the training of future pilots. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the German High Command decided to copy the Soviet policy of using slower biplanes to over-fly enemy positions at night in what can best be described as "nuisance attacks." Employing these tactics, the German Go 145s would fly over Soviet forces at night using loud speakers, light bombs, guns, and rockets. Their actual military impact was minimal, but their psychological impact was regarded as significant by the German leadership. The records are unclear as to the impact was from the Soviet point of view. The Go 145 modeled here is one of these "night raiders." The Go 145 continued in this role along with being a first rate trainer throughout the war. Over 10,000 Go 145s of all variants were built.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Arsenal VG-33 was designed by the Arsenal de l'Aéronautique in order to replace the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. It was a light fighter constructed of wood, but it had a powerful armament and excellent performance. The prototype first flew in the Spring of 1939. An order for 220 aircraft was placed by the French government in September of 1939, immediately after the outbreak of World War II. This was subsequently increased to 1,000 aircraft in early 1940. Unfortunately for France, only 19 of these excellent machines had been completed by the firm Chantiers Aéro-Maritimes de la Seine by the time of the German invasion of France, and not all of these were actually ready for combat. None of these aircraft reached operational fighter units of the Armée de l'Air in significant numbers before France capitulated in June of 1940. All production stopped following German occupation.]]>

<![CDATA[The Bücker Bü 133 was derived form the Bü 131 [modeled elsewhere in his collection]. The Bü 133 was slightly smaller than its predecessor and had a radial instead of an inline engine. Otherwise, the two machines were very similar in appearance and in purpose. The Bü 133 was originally intended as an aerobatic aircraft for civilian use, but like the Bü 131, it soon was taken over by the Luftwaffe for the training of its pilots. These machines were employed throughout Germany in Luftwaffe flight schools as primary trainers during the entire duration of World War II. The Bü 133 did not, however, begin to replace the Bü 131 nor did it reach the fame or popularity of the Bü 131 Jungmann. A few survived the war and became available to civilians, but conditions in post-war Germany were not conducive to leisure civilian aviation and there was little demand for their use.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This small biplane was developed in 1934, initially for civilian flying schools. The military value of the machine in the training of young Luftwaffe pilots became immediately obvious and the machine was order by the German Air Ministry in large numbers. Over the months leading up to World War II and continuing through the war, over 4,000 of these trainers were manufactured, more than any other German primary trainer. Indeed, most of the Luftwaffe’s pilots began their careers in this machine. The Jungmann is the counter part of the British de Havilland Tiger Moth and the American Stearman Kaydet. The Jungmann was employed throughout Germany in almost all Luftwaffe training schools and was exported to flight training schools in Spain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Japan. Many saw service with auxiliary ground attack squadrons on the eastern front. Carrying 2.2 and 4.4-pound (1 and 2 kg) bombs, they were used at night to maintain non-stop harassment over Soviet lines. Following the war, these little machines became very popular for civilian aerobatic flying. This was one of the truly classic aircraft of all time. Numbers of these little machines were flying in the aerobatic role well into the 1970s.]]>

This was the variant manufactured in the largest numbers and during the 1930s, the 117 was the standard reconnaissance aircraft of the Armée de l'Air. At the beginning of World War II, although the 117 was clearly obsolete, there were still nineteen French reconnaissance units flying these machines. By the time of the German invasion of France in May of 1940, they had been largely replaced by the more modern Potez 63.11s [modeled elsewhere in this collection], but a few remained in service until the French capitulation.]]>

The Luftwaffe used the Si 204s as light personnel transports. The Si 204D was introduced in 1942 and featured a glazed fully rounded nose and bigger engines. The demand for the Si 204D was substantial and their production was undertaken not only by its parent company in Germany, but also by SNCAN in occupied France and by Aero in Czechoslovakia. The Luftwaffe also employed the Si 204D as a multi-engine trainer. Numbers of these aircraft survived the war and reverted to civilian use in post-war peace time.

<![CDATA[This model represents an aircraft of the 1 Staffel, Nachtjagdgeschwader 3, Stade, Germany, January 1945.]]>
</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[The story of the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 was one of "what might have been." The request for the Ta 154 by the German Air Ministry was created by two factors. The first was the German recognition of the success of the British all-wood de Havilland Mosquito light bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The second was the need for a high performance night fighter to counter the night time bombing raids of the British Royal Air Force that were rapidly destroying German industry. Further, the use of non-essential wood spared the use of metal, which was in short supply and the use of wood could utilize the expertise of German woodworkers. The first Ta 154 prototype was flown by its designer Kurt Tank himself. Its performance was excellent and the machine was given approval for pre-production manufacture utilizing the new FuG 220 Lichtenstein radar. But disaster struck. Allied bombing destroyed the plant in Wuppertal, Germany, that manufactured the Tego-Film adhesive used in gluing the plywood of the Ta 154s. This forced the use of an alternative glue to attach the plywood for the newer machines. These newer Ta 154s, manufactured with the alternative adhesive, began breaking up in mid-flight killing their flight crews. Thus, the program was terminated on August 14, 1944, and a potentially outstanding night fighter was lost to the Luftwaffe.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fokker T.IV was designed and built by Fokker for the Royal Dutch Navy to be used for reconnaissance duties in patrolling and protecting the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. The seaplane’s fuselage was of steel tubular construction with fabric covering except for metal skin in areas of the nose. Its wings were of fabric covering over wood framing and the floats were metal. The T.IV first flew on June 7, 1927. Numbers of these machines were in Royal Netherlands Naval service until 1935, when they were replaced by the Fokker T.IV A [modeled here]. The T.IV A was a more modern version of the original machine with more powerful engines and enclosed powered gun turrets. Like the T.IV, the T.IV A was employed in the reconnaissance role, but the machine could also carry a torpedo, bombs, or mines internally. With the Japanese invasion of the East Indies, these aircraft were easy targets for modern fighters, but succeeded in inflicting appreciable casualties among the enemy troop transports and naval vessels. Those that were not shot down were destroyed on the surface. Detailed records are lacking, but apparently none survived the Japanese occupation.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Aichi H9A1 had a colorless operational history during World War II. Indeed, its existence was totally unknown to the Allies until after the war was concluded. The Japanese aircraft of WWII had names that were difficult for Americans to understand. To make identification of Japanese aircraft easier and to avoid confusion in communication, the United States gave every Japanese aircraft a code name by assigning it a common English first name. Fighters were given male names, bombers female names. Trainers and utility aircraft were given various names—often trees or flowers. The Aichi H9A1 was so obscure that it was the only WWII Japanese aircraft that the Allies knew nothing about until the war's end and thus it was the only Japanese WWII aircraft that was never given a code name. The role of the machine was to train pilots and crew for flying boats. The Aichi H9A1 is noteworthy because it was the only flying boat of any of the war’s combatant nations that was specially designed in a training role. Development of the machine began in January 1940 and the first prototype flew in September 1940. Twenty four were built in 1942 and 1943 and four more in 1944. They were used exclusively in training roles until the final months of the war when the worsening status of Japan resulted in a few being used for reconnaissance about the coastal areas of the Japanese home islands.]]>

<![CDATA[In 1936, the Japanese Navy instructed Aichi and Kawanishi to draw up a seaplane specifically intended for nighttime reconnaissance duties. An Aichi team lead by Morishige Mori won the competition during a fly off in June 1937. The new Aichi E11A1 was put into production in April 1938 as "Navy type 98 Night Reconnaissance Seaplane" [Allied code name "Laura"]. Seventeen units were built between 1937 and 1940. These were used almost exclusively for nocturnal scouting missions around the occupied islands of the South Pacific seized by Japan during the early months of World War II. As the war progressed and Japan’s island conquests were recaptured by the Allies, the Aichi E11A1s were withdrawn to the Japanese home islands, where they continued in the same role until the war’s end. Given their night missions, they were painted overall in a flat midnight black.]]>

<![CDATA[This machine was designed and built by the Italian firm Breda Aviation in the late 1930s. It was originally intended as a light six-passenger transport.

Indeed, these two aircraft are almost indistinguishable in appearance. The machine’s acceptance in the commercial market was minimal, but with the entry of Italy into World War II, the need for all variety of aircraft prompted the Regia Aeronautica to place orders for this small transport. It was little used and remains one of those machines that have been forgotten in history. Records are minimal, but it seems that the Ba.44 was mainly confined to operations within Italy and Sicily, and was used for the transport of senior officers of the Italian military and as an air ambulance.]]>

All other of the war’s many target tugs were obsolete machines that were relegated to target towing duties in their declining years. The Martinet, manufactured by Miles, first flew on April 24, 1942. The machine had a wind-operated winch on the port side of the fuselage that was used to deploy and retract the target sleeve drogue that it towed. The machine was an instant success and fulfilled all of the Royal Air Force’s specifications. Between 1942 and 1945, more than 1,700 Martinets were built.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was a continuation in the evolution of the Lavochkin fighters designed by Semyon Alekseyevich Lavochkin. His previous fighters, the LaGG-3 and the La-5, had given good service at a time when the Soviet Union was severely stressed by the German invasion. The La-7 was essentially an upgraded modification of the La-5 and continued on with a very similar appearing airframe, but one that incorporated much more metal in its construction than its predecessor. The La-7 also had a more powerful engine and greater fire-power. It first flew in November of 1943 and entered production the following spring. Because of its later arrival on the scene, it was produced in lesser numbers than was the La-5. One of the main roles for the La-7s during the fighting on the Soviet front was escorting the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection] while on their assaults on German armor.]]>

Production of the Ki-54 began in 1940 and 1,368 were built through the early months of 1945. The two variants were a training aircraft [used in pilot education and in the instruction of navigators and communication personnel] and a transport [mainly used for senior military staff and senior civilian officials]. The Ki-54 [Allied code-named "Hickory"] was of all-metal construction with retractable landing gear. Numbers of these aircraft survived the war and were subsequently used in post-war civilian service. As they were not intended for use in combat zones, most Ki-54s were not painted in camouflage coloration. This was the case with the aircraft modeled.]]>

<![CDATA[This model represents an aircraft of the 3 Staffel, Zerstörergeschwader 1, Tunisia, North Africa, March 1943.]]>
</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[In the 1930s, as the Luftwaffe was emerging from the restraints placed upon German aviation by the treaty ending World War I, Luftwaffe leaders seemed convinced that a so-called heavy fighter was an aircraft of the future. These concepts gave rise to the Me 110 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] and to the machine modeled here, the Me 210. Even while the Me 110 was just entering production, the Luftwaffe placed a specification for another twin engine heavy fighter. Willy Messerschmitt designed the Me 210 to fill this specification. His firm’s reputation was so strong that the Luftwaffe ordered mass production of the new heavy fighter even before the prototypes made their first flights on September 5, 1939, just 4 days after the start of World War II. This proved to be a mistake. The Me 210 was not a satisfactory aircraft. It suffered from an array of faults from inadequate power plants to airframe troubles to flight instability. The Me 210 had many new features: remotely controlled rear machine guns, a bomb bay in the ventral portion of the fuselage and new Venetian blind type dive brakes under the wings for dive bombing. The Me 210 remained a major problem despite efforts to resolve its many aerodynamic faults. With production machines flowing off the assembly lines, and with no evident solutions to the Me 210’s problems, the decision was made in January 1942 to terminate all production. Another event arising from this profound decision and from the failure of the Me 210 was the forced resignation of the famous German aeronautical engineer and founder of the Messerschmitt company, Professor Willy Messerschmitt. Some of the existing Me 210s were deployed to operational units in North Africa, the Balkans, and Greece—away from significant Allied fighter penetration. If there was some benefit to the Luftwaffe from this machine, it was that Messerschmitt engineers learned from their errors and from the Me 210 they built the Me 410 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Me 410 was a very great success.]]>

<![CDATA[Following the development and the availability of the FA-13 remotely controlled gun system sighted by a periscope, the German Air Ministry requested proposals for a fast twin-engine attack bomber that would incorporate this new defensive equipment. Arado, with an aircraft designed by its engineer Hans Rebeski, were awarded the contract. Despite the great potential of this new machine, its career was plagued with developmental problems largely due to the machine's technological sophistication. Multiple changes to the prototypes included lengthening of the fuselage and alteration of wing and undercarriage. However, the aircraft’s flight instability continued to adversely impact its usefulness. Only forty units, all prototypes, were built and the machine was never put into mass production. Some of the prototypes were unofficially assigned to combat units. The prototype of this model flew with the above combat unit in attacks on the Soviet Murmansk railway system.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Focke-Wulf 190, introduced by the Germans in 1941, had such superior performance at high altitude over the Spitfire Mk V that the Royal Air Force ceased operations over France for several months. A quick solution to this problem was found to be the installation of the Rolls-Royce Merlin 61series engine with a two-stage supercharger in the Spitfire Mk V airframe. Starting in 1942, mark numbers were preceded by a letter or letters denoting the role of the aircraft: F for fighter, LF for low altitude fighter, HF for high altitude fighter, FR for fighter reconnaissance, and PR for photo reconnaissance. The engine installed was specific to the role assigned. The aircraft modeled can be identified as an LF because of the serial number, and is powered by specially derated Merlin 66 engine. A few modifications to the fuselage were required in order to install the larger Merlin power plants. The Mk IX was built in greater numbers than any other Mark. It retained the same offensive armament as its predecessor: two 20 mm cannon and four machine guns. During the later months of the war, Spitfire Mk IXs were very active in the interception and destruction of incoming German Fieseler Fi 103 unmanned "Buzz Bombs" [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The aircraft modeled was flown by a French pilot who had escaped the German occupation after the fall of France and subsequently joined the Royal Air Force. The French Cross of Lorraine can be seen beneath the cockpit canopy on the port side of the aircraft’s fuselage.]]>

<![CDATA[The Yak-9 was a continuation in the line of Soviet fighters that were the dominant type employed by the Soviet Union during World War II. A total of over 30,000 Yak fighters of all variants were built by Soviet industry between 1941 and the end of the war. The Yak-9 was designed with the intent of extending its operative range. This was achieved by a redesign of its wings to allow for larger fuel tanks. The Yak-9 first saw combat at the Battle of Stalingrad and was in intense service throughout the remainder of the war. The "T" variant, modeled here, was used in the anti-tank role in addition to being an air-to-air combat fighter. Its cockpit was moved further back in the fuselage and its armament was changed. The Yak-9, like its predecessors, was an excellent aircraft and was competitive with the best German fighters deployed on the Soviet front. Yak-9s remained in active service with the Red Army Air Force long after the war and were retired well into the 1950s. They were also used by the Soviet satellite states during the early years of the Cold War.]]>

<![CDATA[When it arrived on the scene, this small racy looking aircraft looked more like a civilian racing plane of the 1930s than a serious military fighter. Dewoitine built the machine in response to a 1930 specification from the Armée de l'Air for a new fast interceptor fighter with high performance. The D.501 was the first Dewoitine fighter design to abandon the parasol single-wing configuration that had been heretofore popular with the firm. The machine’s first flight was in November 1934. Its trials were accepted by the French government and a delivery of 233 was subsequently made to the Armée de l'Air beginning in May of the following year. Export D.501s were sold to Venezuela and Lithuania. While they were regarded as quite modern when they entered service in the mid-1930s, D.501s were obsolete by the outbreak of World War II and had been largely replaced by more modern French fighters. Even these supposedly more modern fighters were far below the standards of the German fighters they were to oppose in the Battle of France. At the beginning of World War II, Dewoitine D.501s still equipped Escadrilles Régionale de Chasse. They, along with their more modern counterparts, faired very poorly in the air battles over France during late 1939 and midway through 1940—when France capitulated.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was developed by the French Hanriot Aircraft Company as a multi-engine trainer for the French Armée de l'Air. Its role was to provide a platform to convert pilots who had completed their single-engine aircraft flight training into the multi-engine format. The first prototype of the H.232 flew on July 22, 1937. Modifications were required that delayed the production of the aircraft. The first H.232s were delivered to the Armée de l'Air in February of 1939, just 7 months before the outbreak of World War II. The Finnish government ordered 22 of these machines, but the Soviet invasion of Finland and the beginning of World War II cancelled their delivery. Following the French capitulation in June of 1940, control of the French aircraft industry was taken over by the German Luftwaffe. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941, Finland found itself fighting the Soviet Union along with Germany. Although a somewhat reluctant one, Finland was now an ally of Germany. Realizing that the Finns were in desperate need of military aircraft, Germany sent numbers of H.232s that they had seized to their new northern ally. Thus, in the end, the Finns received the H.232s that they had ordered two years before. They converted the machines into light bombers and ground attack aircraft and used them in their continuing war with the Soviet Union. They remained in service into 1945.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This modern high-performance fighter was designed as a replacement for the aging A6M Zero [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which had become out-classed by the new generations of Allied fighters. The A7M [Allied code-named "Sam"] was much larger than the Zero, had hydraulically-operated folding outer wing panels, a huge powerful engine, and heavy armament. This machine, designed by Mitsubishi’s chief engineer Jiro Horikoshi, had great potential but became caught up in a political conflict between its Mitsubishi manufacturer and Japanese naval leaders. This ensuing controversy delayed the design and subsequent production of the Reppū due to multiple changes demanded by the Navy. Furthermore, by the time the A7M was being designed, the fortunes of Japan had faded, materials needed for aircraft construction were in short supply, and the Japanese Imperial Navy no longer had any functioning aircraft carriers. Although plans were made for mass production, only nine prototypes and one production aircraft were ever built and they all were still in pre-production flight trials when the war ended without any A7M having fired a shot.]]>

<![CDATA[Both of the major axis powers of World War II, Germany and Japan, suffered from a similar problem—the lack of a long-range strategic bomber. In late 1942, Japanese aviation authorities sought to end this deficiency and directed the Nakajima company to design and build such a machine. The Japanese had no experience in the construction of such large bombers and, not surprisingly, it took over two years for design and development of the first prototype [Allied code-named "Rita"]. It first flew on October 23, 1944. Two other prototypes flew in April and June of 1945, but by this time the Japanese industrial base was reeling from daily American bombings. Materials were in short supply and factories were often without electrical power. Only four prototypes were completed, three of which underwent test flights. None were ever assigned to operational combat units. Following the Japanese capitulation, the four prototype G8N1 bombers were carefully evaluated by American aviation experts. They were found to be superb machines with outstanding performance. Had they been available in numbers early in the war they would, doubtless, have had a major impact on the conflict.]]>

<![CDATA[This model represents an aircraft of the 1001st Naval Sentai, Micronesia Islands, May 1943.]]>
</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by Kawanishi in response to a 1940 Japanese Navy specification for a high-performance floatplane fighter. The Japanese leadership foresaw the need for fighter protection of Pacific islands they intended to capture in the impending war—islands where no land airfield was available. Seaplane fighters flying from island lagoons were thought to be needed. The resultant fighter, although a float plane, was quite excellent and capable of holding its own against many of the Allied fighters of the day. Its powerful engine drove counter rotating propellers, giving it a speed of over 300 mph [however, the counter-rotating propellers were replaced eventually with conventional three bladed propellers due to many problems]. This, combined with heavy firepower, made the N1K1 [Allied code-named "Rex"] a formidable opponent. In fact, the machine was so successful that it became the basis for the Kawanishi N1K2-J Shiden, a land based fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The later was one of the finest Japanese fighters of World War II and its evolution was unique, and probably the only instance during the war that a highly successful land fighter was derived from a seaplane fighter. The N1K1’s late arrival in operational service [late 1943] coupled with material shortages associated with Japan’s failing war time status, resulted in only 89 aircraft produced, and only four with counter-rotating propellers. They were fine aircraft, probably the finest seaplane fighters of the war. Although the model shows the counter-rotating propeller configuration the data is provided for the single propeller version.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[As World War II progressed, Japan’s cities and industrial base were being systematically destroyed by American B-29 bombing. The desperate need for a fast, high-performance interceptor to counter the bomber attacks became a very high priority for the Japanese High Command. Kyūshū Aircraft received an order to design and produce such a machine. The result was without question the most unusual fighter of World War II. What was to become the J7W1 Shinden was designed by Masaoki Tsuruno. His new machine was the only aircraft in the world with its elevators positioned in the front of the fuselage in a so-called "canard" position. The engine was behind the pilot and drove a huge six bladed pusher propeller. The propeller’s diameter was so great that, in order to clear the ground, the aircraft’s tricycle type landing gear had to be extremely long. The machine had a high "on stilts" appearance when it was sitting on the ground. Freed of a forward propeller, the fuselage nose could hold the machine’s very heavy armament. Japan’s situation was so critical in late 1944 that this revolutionary fighter was ordered into mass production before its first prototypes had even flown. Only two prototypes were finished. One of these flew on its maiden flight on August 3, 1945, just 12 days before Japan’s capitulation. Addition trial flights were conducted on August 6th and 8th. The machine’s performance seemed excellent during these brief 45-minute flights. The war ended before the J7W1 Shinden could complete its trials and before it could be put into action against the American bombers—the role for that it had been created.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The use of submarine-based attack aircraft was considered by many nations after the development of these two tools of war. However, it was only the Japanese that put the two together in actual operation. In May 1942, the Japanese Imperial Navy ordered the Aichi Company to build a seaplane that could be carried aboard the new large type I-400 Japanese submarines. The result was the Aichi M6A1 Seiran, which made its first flight in November 1943. With wings that folded against the fuselage and tail structures that also folded, 3 of these machines could be carried in a hangar tube fixed to the deck of the submarine. Upon surfacing, the aircraft were assembled and catapulted into flight for their bombing mission. Twenty-eight of these machines were completed. The operational concept of submarine-based attack bombers was put in place when, on July 23, 1945, the super submarines I-400 and I-401 with three Aichi M6A1s each departed the Japanese home islands for an attack upon a United States Naval Aircraft Carrier task force staged at Ulithi atoll in the Pacific. The original attack plan for this new submarine-based air attack was to destroy the Panama Canal, but the pressures of the U.S. Fleet on the Japanese home islands lead to the carrier task force becoming the higher priority. On August 15, 1945, while the two submarines were en route to their target, they received radio messages from their headquarters advising that Japan had surrendered. The two submarines and their six attack bombers were order to return to the nearest Japanese port. Thus, the concept of submarine based air attack lost its chance to prove that it was a viable tactic of war.]]>

<![CDATA[The Focke-Wulf Ta 152 was the final Fw 190 variant to come from the drawing board of the famous Kurt Tank, chief design engineer of Focke-Wulf. The machine was given the indicator initials "Ta" in his honor. Its wingspan was considerably longer then previous Fw 190s; it had a more powerful engine, greater speed, and superior fire power. By the middle of 1944, effort was being made to produce the Ta 152 in numbers. The fighter was quickly recognized for what it was—one of the best propeller fighter aircraft of World War II. Production Ta 152s began equipping Luftwaffe fighter units in late 1944. They were employed in the defense of the Reich against the aggressive bombing attacks of Allied bombers that were rapidly destroying German industry and German’s ability to continue the war. Some of the Ta 152s were used to protect the air fields of the new Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters [modeled elsewhere in this collection], for it was only during takeoff and landing that the Me 262s were vulnerable to Allied fighter attack. The virtue of the Ta 152 was perhaps best recorded by its designer himself. In December of 1944, Kurt Tank was flying one of his Ta 152s when he was intercepted by a pair of American P-51 Mustangs [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Tank’s tactic of escape was quite simple. He opened the throttle to full and literally left the Mustangs "in the dust." However, the overall impact of this wonderful fighter on the final outcome of World War II was non-existent. As good as they were—and they were very good—they arrived too late and in too few numbers to exert any effect.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was the only Italian heavy four-engine bomber of World War II. The aeronautical engineer Giovanni Casiraghi, who between 1927 and 1936 had worked in the United States’ aeronautical industry, undertook design of the new machine. With this exposure, he had become familiar with the concepts of heavy bomber design. The P.108 project began in 1937 and produced an all-metal low-wing heavy bomber with four engines and a very potent defensive armament. Among its numerous new advanced features were flexible guns mounted in two wing turrets remotely controlled from two clear domes in the dorsal rear fuselage. This was a concept that became operational years before deployment of this same feature in the American Boeing B-29 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The first prototype P.108 took to the air on November 24, 1939, and was immediately recognized as a fine aircraft. Being a new aircraft of a design unfamiliar to the Regia Aeronautica, a long period of evaluation followed. The only combat bomber unit to deploy the P.108, the 274th Bomber Squadriglia, received their P.108s beginning in early 1942 and flew their first mission in July of that year. Approximately 36 of these fine machines were produced. They were mainly used as night bombers attacking Gibraltar and Allied positions in Algeria and North Africa. The P.108s career ended in September of 1943, when the Italians capitulated to the Allies. The surviving P.108s were based in an area of Italy still held by the Germans. The Luftwaffe, for some unexplainable reason, had little interest in these fine machines and never used them in their intended role as a long-range bomber. They did employ a few of the captured P.108s as transports. The very significant potential of these bombers was never fully exploited by the Axis powers. The prototype of this P.108 is in a camouflage scheme designed for night missions.]]>

<![CDATA[The Caproni 314 was a direct descendent of the Caproni 311 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Ca.311 was seriously underpowered and had inadequate armament for successful operation against modern British fighters. The upgrading of the Ca.311 resulted in the Ca.314. Although of similar design, there were changes, the most obvious of that was a stepped forward fuselage in place of the bullet-shaped glazing of the Ca.311. However, the most important changes were increased engine power and improved armament. The 470 hp radial engines of the Ca.311 were replaced with 700 hp inline engines. The Ca.314 was given heavier armament, although it remained inadequate. The Ca.314 was produced in different versions—reconnaissance, light bomber, and torpedo bomber. It is the latter version that is modeled here. The Regia Aeronautica used these torpedo bombers in attacks against Allied shipping during the North African campaigns. Ca.314s were also deployed in combat in the Balkans and in the Soviet Union. Overall, they rendered superior performance to the Ca.311, but were still not truly first class machines and suffered severe losses to Allied fighters.]]>

The performance of the Ro.44 was not equal to modern British fighters, but the relative limited range of the latter made it very unlikely that during the early phases of the war that the Ro.44s would encounter enemy fighter opposition. The Ro.44s could, however, counter those British bombers attempting to attack the Italian held islands. Due to their poor performance compared to modern fighters, the use of the Ro.44 was very limited. Only about 30 were built. With the arrival of British fighters in numbers, as the fortunes of war turned against the Axis powers in the Mediterranean theater, the Ro.44s were badly mauled and were withdrawn from service.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Japanese had a pattern of developing many different reconnaissance aircraft during World War II. Where the United States had but a few types, the Japanese continued to design and build one type of new machine after the other. The Kawanishi E15K1 was one of the last types produced by the Japanese aeronautical industry before the end of the war. The purpose of the aircraft [code named "Norm" by the Allies], was to replace older types then in use aboard Japanese capital ships. The Norm was unique in having counter-rotating propellers driven by a very powerful engine, which gave it excellent speed and performance. Two pins attached the center float. To improve speed by reducing drag, the forward pin could be pulled and the float jettisoned, increasing maximum speed by 58 mph (93 km/h). While an interesting concept, six of the fifteen E15K1s were lost because of failures of the float jettison system. In addition, the out-rigger floats beneath each wing retracted into wells under each wing tip when the machine was in flight. It was one of the most modern and fastest shipboard reconnaissance aircraft of the war. The prototype of this model was deployed as one of seven such aircraft aboard the giant super battleship Musashi which, along with its sister ship Yamato, were the largest and most powerful battleships ever built. They had nine 18-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, and twelve 5-inch guns and weighed over 64,000 tons. They were the ultimate and final examples in the long evolution of big gun battleships, an evolution that had begun centuries before. Ironically, neither of these giants ever inflicted any damage on any Allied ship during the entire war. They were both sunk in separate naval engagements by American carrier-based bombers, actions that marked the end of the "battleship era."]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In the very early 1930s, Kawasaki had developed and built a single seat monoplane fighter, the Ki-5. It was of all-metal construction with an inverted gull-wing. The Ki-5 was an object failure. The Imperial Japanese Army needed a new fighter and placed a specification for one in 1933. Having had a failure with its first efforts with a monoplane, Kawasaki reverted to a biplane type and produced the Ki-10 [Allied code-named "Perry"]. The fuselage was all-metal; its wings were fabric covered. It first flew in March of 1935. Between January of 1935 and December of 1938, a total of 580 Ki-10s were manufactured. They remained the mainstay of the Japanese Army fighter force until well into 1940. The Ki-10s were the last biplane fighters in Japanese military service but they saw extensive use during the Japanese invasion of China prior to World War II, and continued to be an active part of the Japanese Army fighter force during the early years of that conflict. By 1942, they were hopelessly obsolete when confronted by modern monoplane fighters and most Ki-10s were withdrawn from fighter service and used as trainers.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[After a 1936 Royal Air Force specification for a medium bomber, the Avro Company designed the Manchester using a new airframe and the new Rolls-Royce Vulture engines. The result was a total failure. Yet, the aircraft did fulfill an unexpected and vital role in Great Britain's war effort. Failure of the aircraft was due to reliability problems with the Vulture engines and their inability to deliver their designed power along with some airframe defects. Despite the many problems with the Manchester, they began equipping RAF units in November of 1940, the same month that the British four-engine Short Sterling heavy bomber entered service with RAF Bomber Command. A total of 202 Manchesters were built. Forty percent were lost in operations and another 25 percent to non-combat crashes. The remaining aircraft were removed from service by June of 1942. However, to its credit, the Manchester paved the way for the Avro Lancaster [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the RAF's finest heavy bomber of WWII. Much of the Lancaster's technology and airframe came from the Manchester. The major difference between the two machines was that the Lancaster was given four of the excellent and powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. Without the Manchester, the superb Lancaster might not have seen the light of day.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This was the final fighter produced by Reggiane for the Regia Aeronautica during World War II. Many consider this the most aeronautically beautiful of all Italian fighters, if not the most beautiful of all fighters of World War II. It is nice to be beautiful but this is not why fighters exist. They exist to be the killers of the sky. In this regard the Re.2005 failed to fulfill its expectations as the finest Italian fighter. Although the Re.2005 outwardly resembled its predecessors, the Re.2001 and the Re.2002 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], it was a very different machine internally. The Reggiane engineering team completed the design of the new fighter rapidly, but availability of the engine caused substantial delays in the Re.2005s operational appearance. It first flew on May 9, 1942, and required in a number of modifications to correct airframe structural weaknesses. Delayed by these changes, only thirty Re.2005s came off the assembly lines. They entered operation with combat units in May of 1943, seeing their first service in the defense of Sicily. Actual combat revealed continued structural weaknesses to the extent that on August 25, 1943, after less than four months of operational service, the Re.2005s were withdrawn from combat. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans seized about a dozen of the machines. Their fate in German hands is unclear. None served with the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force. The Regia Aeronautica destroyed all Re.2005s remaining in Italian service. The Re.2005 had no impact on the war and must be considered, for all their external beauty, a failure.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This unique machine was designed by Heinrich Focke in 1942 with the intent of broadening the horizons of Germany's submarines. Both the visual range of observers and the radar range were severely limited by the low profile of submarines. The Roto-Kite did not have a motor but was launched like a kite from the deck of a fast moving submarine. The machine's three-bladed rotor could elevate it to a height from that the observer scanned the ocean for potential targets and for the approach of any Allied warships. Typically having 150 m (492 feet) of tow cable available, it was possible to reach an altitude of 120 m (394 feet). From this altitude, the observer had an effective visual range of 40 km (25 miles) compared with 8 km (5 miles) from the U-boat deck. Communications from the Roto-Kite to the submarine were by telephone. Pilots received training in a wind tunnel. Two hundred production Fa 330s was manufactured in the Hoyenkamp, Germany plant of Weser Flugzeugbau. Given the exposure of the observer to sea spray, use of the system was limited to warm waters. The systems were of limited operational value and infrequently used since the U-boat commanders disliked the time it took to recover the Roto-Kite and the observer and submerge.]]>

It was intended as a heavy long-range fighter to assist in Mediterranean convoy protection. It was also to be capable of serving in a ground attack role in the support of Italian land forces. It failed badly in both missions. Its performance left much to be desired and it was soon learned that it could not compete with modern single engine Allied fighters. Although it first flew in 1939, it was not immediately put into production. With the urgent need to protect convoys attempting to supply the Axis forces in North Africa, the production decision for the Ro.57 was revisited and the aircraft placed into limited production. Only 50 to 60 had been built when production ceased after the Italian armistice in September of 1943.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was derived from the Petlyakov Pe-2, a dive bomber modeled elsewhere in this collection. The first Pe-3s did not have a bomb bay and had a shorter wingspan than the Pe-2. Only twenty-three Pe-3s were built. To improve producibility, the Pe-3 bis was introduced with the design was changed to closely resemble the Pe-2. Indeed, their external appearance is almost identical and the Pe-3 bis reverted to the bomb bay configuration of the Pe-2. The Pe-2 production line at GAZ 22 completed every second aircraft as a Pe-3 bis. Approximately 300 Pe-3 bis were built. The difference in the machines was in their armament and internal equipment. The Pe-3 bis was initially employed as a heavy fighter in the defense of the larger Soviet cities. Its most important use was as a long-range anti-submarine aircraft, that would fly out into the Artic Ocean and provide protection for the Allied convoys from Great Britain and the United States headed to Murmansk with vital war supplies for the Soviet Union. Functioning in this role, the Pe-3s came to be called by the Allied seamen manning these convoys "The Guards of the Artic Convoys." Like the Pe-2 before it, the Pe-3 bis gave excellent service from the time of its appearance until the end of the war, flying over 10,000 combat missions with great distinction. Perhaps this is a tribute to the designer of the Pe series of aircraft, V.M. Petlyakov, who was killed in a Pe-2 during a test flight.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This sleek and modern-looking monoplane aircraft was the last in the linage of Polikarpov fighters. The original design of this new fighter, as of March of 1940, was to employ the Shvetsov M-90 1,750 hp engine. The airframe was of mixed construction with wood on sections of the fuselage and metal covered wings. In December of 1940, it became known that the new M-90 engine would not be available and the first prototype was not completed. The I-185 project was placed on hold until a 1,200 hp Shvetsov M-81 power plant was fitted to the I-185 airframe. The new fighter's first flight revealed the M-81 did not to have adequate power and again the project was placed on hold. Tests with the 1,330 hp M-82A were encouraging, but the similarly powered La-5 was chosen for production. A 1,700 hp Shvetsov M-71 engine was then placed in the airframe in May of 1941 and trials began evaluating several prototypes. Trials were conducted between November 1942 and January 1943. The testing facilities reported "The 1-185 was superior to all contemporary fighters." Several accidents caused by engine failures and a collision with a parked aircraft curbed enthusiasm for the I-185. By that time, production of the M-71 engine was unavailable in sufficient numbers and airframe production was limited by other aircraft production. Only a small number of prototypes of the I-185 were ever built, and it never went into mass production.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was the last in the line of World War II fighters designed by Mario Castoldi. Its external appearance is almost identical to its immediate predecessor the Macchi M.C.202 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The only significant difference was their different power plants and radiators. The M.C.205 had a more powerful engine. Perhaps, the most important difference was the M.C.205's vastly improved armament—the correction of a fault that had plagued its ancestors. With a more powerful engine, the M.C.205 was faster and more maneuverable. The new fighter first flew on April 19, 1942, and was quickly put into production, with the first production model coming off the assembly lines in September of 1942. Production was very slow due to material shortages and interruptions in electric power at its factories following Allied bombing of Italian electric power plants. Only ten machines were delivered by the end of 1942 and it was in June of 1943 that a hundred had been built. Although few in numbers, the M.C.205 performed well and was a match for its opponents. After the Italian capitulation in September of 1943, 37 of these machines became part of the Italian Cobelligerent Air Force and flew with the Allies, while 140 flew with the German-controlled Repubblica Sociale Italiana Air Force. It is one of these machines that is modeled here.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was designed and built by the French aircraft company Potez in response to a French Navy specification for a shipboard reconnaissance machine for use on its battleships and cruisers. The design requirements included the ability for launch by a catapult or from the sea. In addition, the wings were required to fold to simplify storage aboard ship. It first flew in 1935, and after satisfactory flight trials, it began equipping French ships a year later. Only sixteen Potez 452s were built. They remained active as reconnaissance platforms during the early months of World War II. During these early months, there was no significant naval action in the Mediterranean. The warships upon which the Potez 452s were serving saw no real combat against German forces. After the French capitulation to Germany in June of 1940, these aircraft continued to serve on their ships and ironically were briefly engaged against their former ally Great Britain. Other Potez 452s were deployed to French colonies in French Indochina, which included reconnaissance duty in a short conflict between these Vichy French controlled colonies and Thailand, a little remembered side event of World War II. The prototype of the Potez 452 modeled here served aboard the French Battleship Lorraine, which was deployed in the French Mediterranean Fleet during these calm early months of the war. The Lorraine's insignia, the cross of Lorraine, can be seen painted on the port bow of the aircraft. These machines remained in service until 1944, by that time all had been retired or destroyed.]]>

<![CDATA[Although little known, this was France's best bomber of World War II. While the rest of the French bomber fleet was made up of obsolete aircraft out-classed by their German counterparts, this elegant, fast, and sleek attack bomber had performance as good as any of its contemporaries. The trouble was that while orders for 285 had been placed by the Armée de l'Air, only 86 were available when Germany invaded France in May of 1940 and these were caught up in the confusion abounding in France in the early months of the war. Many of these new machines lacked armaments and other essential equipment. Thus, this aircraft, which had such great potential and was so badly need by France, had a career that was non-existent. The Amiot 354 played little role in the defense of France. Following France's capitulation, the Germans converted some of these surviving aircraft into fast transports.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was developed in 1935 as a successor to the Bloch MB.130. The latter aircraft had vanished from the scene by the mid-1930s and played no role in World War II. The MB.131 was to be an improvement on the older aircraft and was intended to operate as a twin-engine medium bomber of high performance. A total of 121 were built, but their intended performance was not as specified and was, in fact, so poor that they were almost immediately withdrawn from the bombing role and relegated to lesser secondary duties such as reconnaissance and transport. Some units of the Armée de l'Air did, however, continue to fly the MB.131 until France's capitulation in June 1940. After the German occupation of France, the German Luftwaffe evaluated the aircraft and found them to be useless and destroyed them rather than attempting to use them in any capacity. Thus a career, lacking distinction, ended and the machine has been all but lost in the history books of WWII.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The F3F was the third in a series of biplane fighters made by Grumman for the United States Navy. It retained the short fat fuselage of its predecessors but had lengthened wings. The F3F-1, powered by a 700 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1535-84, made its maiden flight on March 20, 1935. Redesign resulted from loss of one prototype because of structural weakness and a second prototype in a spin. The first of fifty-four F3F-1s entered service in January of 1936. An upgraded model, the F3F-2 with a more powerful engine and increased fuel capacity, entered service in December 1937. The aircraft had only a brief career on United States aircraft carriers before they were replaced by F4F monoplanes [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. At the time of the entry of the United States into World War II, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the F3Fs had been entirely replaced in front line carrier fighter units. However, about a hundred F3Fs were being used during the early months of the war for fighter training. The prototype of this model has a new olive drab paint scheme, unusual for Navy trainers, which usually were painted in a yellow, blue or gray. The last F3F was struck from Navy service in November of 1943. The performance data are for the F3F-2.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The advances in military aircraft were profound and rapid during the six years of World War II. At the beginning of the conflict many biplanes, which appeared little different and performed little different from World War I machines, were still flying in significant numbers. By the end of the war, military aircraft had undergone incredible changes. No fighter was more advanced than the Ta 283 Abfangjäger. Designed by a Focke-Wulf engineering team, it had two ram jet engines and a single rocket engine. It was projected to be able to reach an altitude of 35,000 feet from take-off in just 2 minutes and 15 seconds and to be able to achieve the speed of sound [Mach 1] in level flight. Wind tunnel tests supported these estimates. Its appearance was modern even judged by 21st Century standards and was very unusual for WWII aircraft in that its fuselage length was greater than its wingspan. The failing fortunes of Germany, however, meant that Focke-Wulf was consumed in the manufacture of more conventional aircraft for the Luftwaffe, leaving little time for the building of such drastically new machines as the Ta 283. These production realities, the complexity of the new aircraft, material shortages, and the Allied bombing of Focke-Wulf plants, meant that only a single prototype had been completed by the time of Germany's capitulation. The new high-performance jet and rocket fighter was awaiting its first flight trials when its factory was over-run by Allied troops. British and American engineers were highly interested in the machine and it was the subject of considerable post-war study.]]>

<![CDATA[World War II gave a great sense of urgency to the development and construction of jet and rocket powered aircraft. The Germans excelled in this area and the imagination of the German engineers was given a free rein. One of the revolutionary new machines to emerge from the drawing boards of the German engineers was the Focke-Wulf PLT Flitzer [Madcap]. It had swept back wings, twin booms with a high set tail plane between them. Prototypes had been built along with numbers of sub-assemblies when Germany was forced to capitulate. The revolutionary new PTL was awaiting flight trials when its factory was captured by Allied troops ending the project and preventing the planned testing of the machine. British and American engineers undertook post-war study of the Flitzer. The British De Havilland DH.100 Vampire has a twin-boom configuration very similar to the Flitzer. The DH.100 prototype’s maiden flight was 20 September 1943 with Geoffrey De Havilland at the controls. Unlike the Flitzer, the British fighter did not have a rocket engine.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The United States Navy issued specifications for a new long-range reconnaissance bomber to replace the Consolidated PBY Catalina [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in the mid 1930s. Consolidated, the builders of the Catalina, responded with plans for the Coronado, a new four-engine flying boat larger and more powerful than the Catalina. The Coronado did not replace the Catalina. It never even came close to doing so. The new four-engine machine first flew on August 13, 1937. Navy budget constraints delayed purchases of the new aircraft. The gathering clouds of war in Europe loosened military spending in the late 1930s and the Navy ordered six of the Coronados. Some developmental problems required refinement before the new machines were delivered to the first Navy unit, VP-13, in December 1940. Additional purchases followed and a total of 210 were built. Instability remained a problem with this aircraft throughout its entire career—instability that was only partly resolved with multiple alterations in its airframe. Nonetheless, Coronados served throughout the war with modest distinction in various roles [transport, air ambulance, weather research, and anti-submarine warfare] in addition to those of reconnaissance and maritime bombing. Still, through all its variations and modifications it could never replace the aircraft it was meant to succeed, the Catalina.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was built by Nakajima in response to a Japanese Imperial Navy 1938 specification for a long range heavy fighter. The Nakajima team was lead by one of its chief engineers, Katsuji Nakamura. The J1N1 [Allied code-named "Irving"] first flew in May of 1941. It was a very aerodynamically smooth machine with long range and excellent performance. However, the J1N1 was never flown in its intended role as a long-range heavy fighter. Instead, it was reconfigured into a high-speed long range reconnaissance machine—the J1N1-C. In the spring of 1943, Japanese military authorities decided to convert a number of the J1N1-Cs into night fighters. This is the aircraft modeled here. They were given a very unusual armament in this configuration. Four 20 mm cannon were mounted in the mid-fuselage area—two pointing up at a 30° angle, two pointing down in the same manner. The concept was for the machine to fly above or below formations of attacking American bombers shooting up or down into their formations. Japanese records contend that two Boeing B-29 bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection] were shot down in this manner—one on December 8, 1944, and the other on January 23, 1945. American World War II records make no mention of these events or of the J1N1-C attacks in general. These night fighters were available in only small numbers and had no substantial effect on the course of the war. None survived the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The great success of the Blohm & Voss Ha 139 floatplane [Modeled elsewhere in this collection] prompted B&V engineers to build a land-based version. The new land-based aircraft emerged in 1938 featuring the same slender fuselage and inverted-gull wings of its predecessor, but with air-cooled radial engines instead of the inline diesels of the Ha 139. The BV 142’s wings were very thick allowing for large fuel tanks [carrying 1,167 Imperial gallons] thus giving the machine exceptionally long range. The floats of the Ha 139 were replaced with two duel wheels for land operation. The machine’s flight deck accommodated a crew of four. The prototype first flew on October 11, 1938, with great success. By the summer of 1939, these machines were equipping the German Airline Lufthansa on trans-oceanic mail routes. After the start of World War II, numbers were converted to military long range reconnaissance aircraft. Since it was to operate far from friendly protective fighters, defensive armament was added along with extensive navigation and radio equipment. The added weight of the new defensive armament and new equipment detracted from the machine’s performance, speed, and range and, worse, the armament actually provided little real protection against enemy fighters. Some of these aircraft were employed as transports during the invasion of Denmark and Norway, but overall their performance in their intended role as a long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft was disappointing. By 1942, all of he machines had been withdrawn from service.]]>

<![CDATA[This biplane fighter was designed and built at the Letov factory in Prague. Its first flight was on March 17, 1933. After testing at the Czech flight facility at Prague-Lethany, modifications were undertaken to improve the machine’s performance. It entered production the following year and began equipping Czech fighter units in June of 1934. The machines remained in front line fighter status with the Czech Air Force until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Historical records are very vague, but apparently none of these machines were ever in combat with the far superior German aircraft during the German invasion or with any Allied aircraft during World War II when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia and controlled of the Czech Air Force. A few of these hopelessly obsolete Letov Š.231s were still serving as trainers and as secondary fighters for the small Czech Air Force during the early months of World War II. The only recorded combat seen by any Letov Š.231 fighter was in the service of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Arado 234B Blitz [modeled elsewhere in this collection] proved to be very successful. Its performance and handling were superb, but it became apparent that greater engine thrust would provide better operational efficiency and allow for a heavier bomb load. Arado’s engineers, therefore, decided to double the number of engines of the Ar 234B Blitz, thus creating the Ar 234C series of jet bombers. Two BMW jet engines were placed in a common paired nacelle under each wing in place of the single engine of the Ar 234B. Other changes included a revised nose, a bulge in the fuselage roof, different side windows with double glazing throughout to improve the cockpits internal pressurization, a larger nose wheel, and revised ailerons. The first Ar 234C prototype first flew in September of 1944, but the BMW engines proved problematic throughout the entire career of the aircraft. A total of only 20 of these machines were built, all were prototypes and no production of the Ar 234C was undertaken. Extensive trials were being conducted on the Ar 234C during the final days of Hitler’s Germany in the winter and spring of 1945. Records are a bit unclear, but it appears that no Ar 234Cs were actually used in combat. Following the war, these machines underwent extensive study and evaluation by the victorious Allied countries.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Ki-46 family of aircraft was built by Mitsubishi in response to a specification issued by the Japanese Army for a new type of aircraft—a long-range, high-altitude, fast reconnaissance machine. The result was an aerodynamically elegant aircraft with excellent performance. A large number of Ki-46 aircraft were produced in a number of variants [the Ki-46 III and the Ki-46 III KAI are modeled elsewhere in this collection]. In addition to the reconnaissance role, some of the Ki-46s were modified into night fighters. It soon became obvious to the Japanese Army leaders that a dedicated trainer for these high-performance aircraft was needed. This modification was the Ki-46 II type 100 [modeled here]. The training version looked much like the operational variants, except for its additional cockpit glazing where the instructor and students sat in tandem within the fuselage. The entire family of Mitsubishi Ki-46 aircraft, including the trainers, were Allied code-named "Dinah."]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The story of this aircraft is one of frustration for Pavel Sukhoi, its designer and the man whose name it bears. The machine was designed as an attack bomber that would be deployed in the close support of Soviet troops. The problem for this aircraft was that at the same time of its development, the Ilyushin Il-2 was being developed as well. The Il-2 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] turned out to be the best ground support aircraft of World War II. No other machine could compete with it—including the Su-6. When these two competing aircraft were placed in trials, the Il-2 came out the clear winner and went into immediate production. The Su-6 was set aside. Its designer attempted to resurrect the Su-6 with the instillation of a more powerful AM-42 power plant together with several other modifications. However, again, the Su-6 could not match the performance of the Il-2, which by this time was in huge mass production. Only six pre-production Su-6s were built. Soviet English language records are unclear about their fate. It seems possible that one or more of these machines were assigned, at least briefly, to operational units of the Red Air Force on the Soviet front. None were known to have survived the war.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[German aeronautical engineering and aeronautical design were probably among the best in the world at the time of World War II, but if it had a failing it was the constant desire to improve its military aircraft. While commendable in theory, the development of a constant stream of new aircraft and new variants of established aircraft required Luftwaffe flight test facilities to constantly evaluate new machines and, more importantly, required German industry to constantly retool in order to build new aircraft. This was unlike the United States, where a few aircraft types were selected and then mass-produced in huge numbers. The 1099 [modeled here] is a classic example of this pattern within the German aeronautical industry. Even as the new revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was just entering its fight testing, Messerschmitt engineers were back at their drawing boards creating the Me 262’s successor, the Me 1099 [modeled here]. Its was larger, faster, had a longer range and heavier armament that the Me 262. However, the German industry was being battered by Allied bombing. There were shortages of materials, electric power, fuel, and pilots. Development of the Me 1099 fell ill to all of these factors and, most of all, to the demands of the Luftwaffe that Messerschmitt turn out their established line of their military aircraft. Sub-assemblies and one prototype of the Me 1099 were completed. The single prototype was in flight testing when the Messerschmitt factory was overrun by Allied troops, ending the project. Whether the projected performance of the machine could have been realized is open to question, but if it had been realized and had the Me 1099 been available to the Luftwaffe in numbers, the European air war would have been dramatically different. The performance data as shown are design estimates.]]>

<![CDATA[In the latter months of World War II, American Boeing B-29 heavy bombers [modeled elsewhere in this collection] were devastating Japanese cities and Japanese industry. The bombing was seriously impacting Japan’s ability to wage war. In a desperate effort to counter these nighttime attacks, the Japanese Imperial Navy converted a number of their new C6N2 high-performance reconnaissance aircraft [modeled elsewhere in this collection] into night fighters. The Nakajima C6N2 reconnaissance machines were, themselves, very new having entered service in late 1944. The C6N2-X night fighter version [modeled here] looked much like the reconnaissance version. Both had high performance, great speed, and the ability to fly at a high altitude [both had the same Allied code-name "Myrt"]. The difference between the two was the armament carried by the night fighter variant, the C6N1-X. It had two forward-firing 20 mm cannon, but more importantly, a 30 mm cannon mounted in the dorsal mid section of its fuselage aimed upward at a 30° angle. Its purpose was to fly beneath the formations of raiding B-29 bombers, to fire the cannon up into the formations and destroy the bombers. World War II historical records are unclear if any B-29s were shot down or even damaged by this scheme. Within a very few days of the time these night fighters became operational the Japanese surrendered, so the concept was never really tested.]]>

<![CDATA[This aircraft was quite well known during the 1930s. It became famous as the machine in which aviation pioneers such as Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post made aviation history by establishing new air routes and records for distance and speed, both within the continental United States and abroad. The Vega was designed and built by the Lockheed company as a commercial venture. It was one of several Lockheed models built with a common wooden monocoque fuselage, although ten Vegas were built with a metal fuselage. The Vega achieved substantial success in sales since it had excellent performance and bested all other available machines. Three Vegas were obtained by the military, each receiving a unique identification. The first, with a metal fuselage, was purchased by the Army Air Corps in 1931 for evaluation, identified as Y1C-12 and later assigned to Bolling Field as an administrative aircraft and was scrapped in 1935. The second was also a metal fuselage airplane. It was also purchased by the Army for evaluation and identified as Y1C-17. It was used for an attempted transcontinental record flight in March 1931. At the time, it was the fastest airplane in the Army Air Corps. It was severely damaged in a forced landing, ending the record flight and the aircraft was scrapped. The third, the aircraft modeled, was built in 1934 and the last Vega built. It had the wood fuselage and was impressed from its private owner in 1942. As UC-101, it was assigned to March Field, California. It was returned to its former owner in August 1944, and was destroyed in a crash in June 1945.]]>

<![CDATA[The German Aircraft Company Dornier designed and built these large seaplanes exclusively for export to the air forces of smaller nations in order to fulfill their needs for reconnaissance aircraft. The Dornier Do 22 was a durable high-wing monoplane that could be fitted with either floats for water use, wheels for land use, or skis for use on snow. The first foreign purchaser of the machine was Yugoslavia, which acquired twelve Do 22s. They were operational with the Royal Yugoslavian Air Force when Germany invaded and over-ran Yugoslavia in 1941. Taking advantage of the aircraft’s extremely long range of over 1,400 miles, eight of these float planes escaped the Germans by flying across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt. Here they formed the 2. Izvidnička Eskadrila [reconaissance squadron] and performed observation coastal patrols under British control. Thus, the machines continued on in the war fighting the nation of their manufacture. Latvia also purchased the Do 22. Their aircraft were sent to Finland when the Germans invaded the Baltic States. Greece, another purchaser of the Do 22, used their aircraft in their unsuccessful defense of their homeland against the Italian and German invasion—again turning German machines against their maker.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Two aeronautical engineers of the Yugoslavian firm Rogožarski A.D., Ljubomir Ilić and Kosta Sivčev, correctly decided that the era of the biplane fighter was over and embarked upon the design of an all-metal monoplane fighter for the Yugoslav Air Force. The project began in secrecy and, indeed, the rest of the world knew nothing of the aircraft until it took to the air. The machine’s initial plans were completed and approved by the Yugoslav military in 1936. Because of official doubts about the design, the first flight of the IK-3 was not until May of 1938. Its fuselage was of steel tube framing with metal sheet covering of the forward sections and with fabric covering of the fuselage’s rear sections and tail. The wings were of wood framing and fabric covering. An unexplained crash of the prototype on January 19, 1939, caused additional delays in the production of the machine which amounted to only twelve aircraft before Germany invaded Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. On that date, six IK-3s were available to the Yugoslav Air Force. They performed with distinction in fierce air battles against overwhelming odds. During air combat, the small and agile IK-3s proved to be the equal of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109s [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. Following the German occupation, production of the IK-3 was stopped leaving twenty-five unfinished on the production line.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This machine was the last biplane reconnaissance aircraft of the Japanese Imperial Army. It was initially produced by Nakajima in response to a 1931 specification for a reconnaissance aircraft that could also be used in the light ground support role. The first Ki-4s began equipping Japanese air units in 1933 and were an active part of Japanese reconnaissance efforts for a number of years thereafter. The Ki-4s saw substantial service in the Sino-Japanese War, which they joined in 1938. They also functioned as light ground attack aircraft in the support of advancing Japanese ground troops. However, these elderly biplane machines were vulnerable to even the oldest and slowest moving enemy fighters. By the time of the entry of Japan into World War II, the Ki-4s were hopelessly obsolete. Those that had not been lost in service or scraped served briefly as elementary trainers or target tugs. All of the Ki-4s were gone by 1943.]]>

As the war progressed, other more modern training aircraft gradually replaced the He 72. The aircraft modeled was painted in a light blue winter camouflage, which is surprising given its role as a non-combatant trainer.

<history>
<![CDATA[The Farman F.222 was the only French four-engine bomber of World War II. Its career in bombing was so short and so disastrous that it is questionable it should, in fact, be called a bomber. The Farman F.222 was derived from France’s first four-engine bomber, the older Farman F.221. The two machines looked very much alike with very similar lines. They differed in that the F.222 had retractable landing gear unlike the fixed landing gear of its forerunner. Delivery of the Farman F.222 to the Armée de l'Air began in the Spring of 1937. A total of 50 were manufactured. It was a large aircraft that stood far off the ground with a high, very broad wing. Beneath it were engine housings, each holding two engines in a pull-push arrangement. The box shaped fuselage, which was such a common design feature of 1930s French bombers, was retained. The Farman F.222 was hopelessly obsolete when World War II began in September of 1939. It was under-powered, slow, not very maneuverable, had inadequate defensive armament, and could carry a relatively small bomb load given the large size of the machine. During the early days of the war before the German invasion of France, the F.222 was used for reconnaissance and leaflet raids over Germany. When Germany invaded the Low Countries and France in May of 1940, the F.222s were used in their intended role as a heavy bomber, but were promptly mauled by modern German fighters. Their losses were so severe that the surviving machines were transferred to the French North Africa Colonies, where they functioned as transports and as marine reconnaissance platforms. By 1944, the few remaining Farman F.222s were withdrawn from service after a not very distinguished career.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This elegant Japanese reconnaissance aircraft was probably the best of its type in World War II. It was designed and built by Mitsubishi under the direction of one of its chief engineers, Tomio Kubo, in response to a 1938 specification for a very fast and high-flying reconnaissance aircraft. When it first flew in November of 1939, it was faster and could fly higher that any aircraft, including the Zero-Sen fighter [modeled elsewhere in this collection] in the Japanese military fleet. So spectacular was its performance that it was safe from all enemy fighter attack. Production began immediately with the first models coming off the assembly lines and equipping Japanese units in March 1941. Modifications continued during the machine’s production, with the newer Ki-46 III [modeled here] being able to achieve just under 400 mph in level flight. The Ki-46 IIIs made clandestine flights over a number of islands and territories, gathering valuable intelligence information before their subsequent invasion by Japanese forces. The machines reigned supreme in their reconnaissance role until the appearance of American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which could reach the high flying Ki-46 IIIs [Allied code-named "Dinah"]. Ki-46s then began to experience mounting losses. Still, they continued to perform with distinction throughout the remainder of the war.]]>

The original Italian power plants were replaced with French Gnome-Rhône engines that necessitated a 1-foot 3-inch lengthening of the fighters’ forward fuselage. Other small modifications were made and the first MÁVAG Héja took to the air on October 30, 1942. The same Hungarian firm, in addition to the modifying the original 70 machines, built under license 203 more of the Hungarian modified fighters for the Royal Hungarian Air Force. The last machine was completed on August 1, 1944, when production ceased. At least one Hungarian squadron flew the MÁVAG Héja in combat on the Soviet front when Hungary was an alley of Germany.]]>

<![CDATA[The desperation of the Japanese to protect their home islands from the advancing Americans reached its zenith in the deployment of this "one-way" suicide machine that was literally a flying bomb. It was designed at the University of Toyko's Aeronautical Research Institute lead by its senior engineer Masao Yamana. The young suicide pilot was given only the most minimal of flight training and then placed in the cockpit of the machine. The canopy was screwed down denying any escape to the doomed pilot. The MXY-7 was then carried aloft under the fuselage of a Mitsubishi G4M2 bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. When the two aircraft reached their target area [the American fleet], the suicide aircraft was dropped and it then glided towards its selected target—usually an aircraft carrier or other large warship. In its final approach, the pilot ignited a rocket engine propelling the MXY-7 into the American ship, detonating 2,560 pounds of high explosives in the nose of the suicide plane. A total of 775 of these suicide aircraft were built. Fortunately for the United States Navy, many of them were never used.]]>

<![CDATA[The first prototype of this aircraft flew in the summer of 1933. It had been designed as a general utility machine that could fulfill many roles for the Luftwaffe. The fuselage was of welded steel tubing with mostly fabric covering, but some metal sheet was used about the nose. The wings were built around metal spars and there were large streamlined bilateral braces between the fuselage and the wings. Its crew of two entered the cockpit through separate cockpit windows that swung upward. The Fw 58 was designed as a utility transport capable of carrying six passengers, but over time it was modified for multiple other roles including multi-engine trainer and air ambulance. It saw extensive service on the Soviet front in this latter role. Some of these machines were modified to serve as the personal transport aircraft of German leaders. An Fw 58 was used in this manner by Kurt Tank, Focke-Wulf’s chief engineer. Total production of Fw 58s during World War II was 1,668 built for German operations and another 319 for export. The machines served with distinction throughout the war in various roles.]]>

<![CDATA[Despite the extensive destruction rained down upon the Japanese industrial base by American bombing, the Japanese aircraft industry continued with desperate efforts to supply the military with much needed machines. The Aichi B7A2 [Allied code name "Grace"] was the last new aircraft to be put into production by the Japanese before their surrender. It was designed to replace the older Nakajima B6N and the Yokosuka D4Y [both modeled elsewhere in this collection], and was a vastly improved carrier-based torpedo bomber. The first prototype flew in May of 1942, but for various reasons it was over two years later before the first production machines left the factory. However, by this time the Japanese had lost all their aircraft carriers and had few skilled pilots left to fly such an advanced high performance aircraft. A total of 114 B7A2s were built. With no aircraft carriers available, all B7A2s were flown from land bases and they saw very limited service. This was a major loss to the Japanese, given their potential performance as one of the finest aircraft carrier-based torpedo bombers of the war.]]>

It was a further refinement of the PWS-12 and -14 series of airplanes. The machine was of mixed construction with steel tube framing covered with metal sheeting over the front fuselage and fabric over the remaining surfaces of the airframe. It had a metal engine cowling with valve head blisters and a fixed landing gear. The PWS-16 was used as a trainer by the Poles throughout the 1930s and during the early weeks of World War II. Prior to World War II, several PWS-16s were sold to Bulgaria for use in their flight training schools. Because of its excellent flight characteristics, a version was developed for dive bombing and was identified as the PWS-26. During the German invasion of Poland in September of 1939, many of these machines were destroyed on the ground by German air attacks during the first hours of the war. Those few that survived the initial onslaught continued on in the flight-training role but for the German Luftwaffe.]]>

While the majority of F.K.51s were employed as elementary trainers within the Netherlands or in reconnaissance roles by the Royal Dutch Air Force in the Dutch East Indies, twenty-eight were clandestinely sold to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, all despite a Dutch embargo on the sale of arms to either side of that conflict. Some of those arriving in Spain were used as light bombers by the Republicans in the Cantabrian region of Spain. The F.K.51s were in active use in Royal Dutch Flight Schools during the first months of World War II in the training of young Dutch pilots, but with the German invasion of the Netherlands in May of 1940, the F.K.51s were deemed obsolete and most never took to the air being too slow and vulnerable. The majority of F.K.51s were destroyed on the ground by attacking Luftwaffe aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was a variant of the original Il-2 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The original Il-2 was a very effective "tank killer" but it had a single weakness—the 13 mm of armor it carried on the under side of its fuselage to protect it from ground fire, together with its heavy cannon and machine guns, made it slower than the German fighters it faced on the Eastern Front. German fighters would attack the Il-2s from the rear with fatal results. This was corrected with the variant of the Il-2 modeled here. The Il-2M3 had a second crew added in the rear cockpit who manned a 13 mm machine gun on a flexible mount in the rear of the cockpit. Upon its initial introduction, the rear gunner gave a serious and often deadly shock to many attacking German fighters, who were closing in on what they thought would be an easy kill. The two-seat Il-2s were the most numerous variant manufactured and gave excellent performances in the epic tank battles on the Soviet front during the last two years of World War II. The importance of the Il-2s can be best summed up by a statement credited to Joseph Stalin: "The Shturmovik is as essential to the Red Army as oxygen and bread." From the beginning of production in 1940 until it was concluded in 1954, no less than 35,000 Il-2s of all variants were built. This approaches an all time world record for the production for any single aircraft type.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was intended to replace the aging Vickers Wellington bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection], but it did not even come close to doing so. The Warwick’s bombing career never materialized. Like the Avro Manchester bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection], the Warwick fell ill to the failure of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engines that had been designed to power it. The Vulture engines proved to be a disaster in test flights in August of 1939. Several other engines were fitted and tried in the Warwick, thus delaying its final production and deployment into service. Finally, the first production aircraft took to the air with American Pratt & Whitney engines in May of 1942. However, by this time it was far too late in the evolution of the war to consider employing the Warwick as a bomber. Too many other better machines were then available for that role. The decision was made to employ the Warwicks now coming off the assembly lines as maritime reconnaissance bombers. Another engine change was made in the GR Mk V variant [modeled here]. This time, Bristol Centaurus radial engines were installed. Also fitted in the GR Mk V variant was an ASV radar and a Leigh Light—an airborne powerful flood light mounted on the undersurface of the fuselage. Both of these were intended for anti-submarine operations. The Warwick never achieved the success its designers had envisioned for it, arriving on the war scene too late to be of much service.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The use of attack aircraft based upon submarines was considered by many nations after the development of these two tools of war. However, it was only the Japanese that put the two together in actual operation. In May 1942, the Japanese Imperial Navy ordered the Aichi Company to build a seaplane that could be carried aboard the new large type I-400 Japanese submarines. The result was the Aichi M6A1 Seiran, [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. The Seiran made its first flight in November 1943. With wings that folded against the fuselage and tail structures that also fold, three of these machines could be carried in a hanger tube fixed to the deck of the submarine. Upon surfacing, the aircraft were assembled and catapulted into flight for their bombing mission. Twenty-eight of these machines were completed. Two Aichi M6A1-K Nanzan were built as trainers for the Seiran float planes. They were identical to the float version, except that the floats were replaced with wheels and the cockpit was modified for an instructor and a student pilot. Using pilots trained in the Nanzans, the operational concept of submarine-based attack bombers was put in place when on July 23, 1945, the super submarines I-400 and I-401 with three Aichi M6A1s each departed the Japanese home islands for an attack upon a United States Naval Aircraft Carrier task force staged at Ulithi atoll in the Pacific. The original attack plan for this new submarine-based air attack was to destroy the Panama Canal, but the pressures of the U.S. Fleet on the Japanese home islands lead to the carrier task force becoming the higher priority. On August 15, 1945, while the two submarines were en route to their target, they received radio messages from their headquarters advising that Japan had surrendered. The two submarines and their six attack bombers were order to return to the nearest Japanese port. Thus, the concept of submarine-based air attack lost its chance to prove that it was a viable tactic of war. Performance data for the M6A1-K is not available. Data is provided for the production M6A1]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Polikarpov I-15 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was a successful fighter for its time in the mid 1930s, but its pilots complained about the poor forward visibility afforded by its upper gull wing, with the pilots having to look over the central wing depression. The I-152 was designed to correct this fault. The central wing section was raised on splayed "N" struts, the "gull" depression having been removed. Additional revisions were made to the airframe, including an elongated engine cowling, a lengthening of the wings and fuselage, and an increased fuel capacity. The first I-152 flew in early 1937. It was deemed adequate for production, which then began the following year. By 1938, China had been invaded by Japan and was in desperate need of fighter aircraft. Producing none of its own, it purchased all the fighters possible from abroad, including 186 of the I-152s from the Soviet Union. It is one of these Chinese machines that is modeled here. Other I-152s were sent to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War where they, along with their predecessors the I-15s, saw substantial action. Only a few of the I-152s were deployed by the Soviet Air Force. More modern mono-wing fighters had become available by the time of their arrival to the scene. However, some I-152s were employed by the Russians during the first weeks after the German invasion in June of 1941. In an interesting turn about, some I-152 fighters were captured intact on the ground by the Finnish Army during the 1939-1940 Winter Soviet-Finnish War and were subsequently turned against the Soviet Union, the country of their manufacture. In both the Soviet and Chinese theaters of operation, the I-152 had a difficult time competing with more modern German and Japanese fighters. Yet, they labored on until replaced by better aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was the last in the long line of piston engine carrier-based fighters built for the United Sates Navy by Grumman. In this linage, each successive new fighter was larger and heavier than its predecessor. The F8F Bearcat reversed this trend and was both smaller and lighter than the F6F Hellcat, yet the F8F was faster, had better performance, and was more heavily armed than the F6F. The Bearcat also corrected a weakness of the F6F—its poor rear visibility. This was achieved by using a bubble canopy. After the F8F’s test trails in 1944 revealed its excellent performance, the Navy placed an order for 2,023 machines. The first of these began equipping Navy fighter squadrons in May of 1945. These units were in the process of becoming familiar with their new fighters when Japan surrendered, ending the war. The Grumman contract for 1,258 machines not yet built was then cancelled, as was a planned contract with General Motors for an additional 1,876 F8Fs. Bearcats served on with the United States Navy until 1952, when they began being replaced by jet fighters. F8Fs were employed by the French Armée de l'Air and by Thailand for a few years longer.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The A-12 evolved from the A-8 design. The A-8s were powered with a Curtiss V-1570 engine. It was the first Curtiss military monoplane, the first with all-metal structure and skin. It had trailing edge flaps and full span leading edge slats. The fuselage had a glazed canopy for its crew of two and an internal bomb bay. The first won the competition against Fokker for a new attack aircraft. Thirteen service test machines were ordered. The first of these was held at the factory and fitted with a Pratt and Whitney 625 HP Hornet engine, and was designated YA-10. It had improved payload but a slightly reduced top speed. Additional improvements were made and the aircraft was ordered into production as the A-12, and previous orders for A-8s were also changed to A-12s. The first machines were delivered to the United States Army in October of 1934. The Shrike pioneered the concept of low-level ground attack with the U.S. Army Air Force and the machines were used in the late 1930s in this role. By the time of the United States’ entry into World War II, Shrikes were obsolete and had been suffering from persisted problems with weak landing gear. The vast majority had either been retired or sent to reserve National Guard Units. However, a few remained with combat units overseas and nine were assigned to the above listed Squadron in Hawaii when Japan struck at Pearl Harbor. They remained on active combat status for only a few more weeks until they were shifted to training duties. The final airworthy A-12s and their successors the A-18s [a much improved version] were grounded from all service in 1943, none having ever been in combat with an enemy.]]>

A prototype of the Aichi E16A1 first flew in August of 1943, but the type was not accepted for production until a year later. The first production aircraft reached the Japanese Imperial Navy in late August of 1944, but by this time there were few Japanese capital ships remaining in the fleet upon which the new reconnaissance seaplanes could be deployed. A total of 256 machines were built. The majority had to remain land-based given the absence of suitable capital ships. The aircraft were never intended for this role, thus, a naval reconnaissance aircraft with excellent performance and potential was lost to the Japanese war effort.]]>

<![CDATA[There is no question that this aircraft had the potential of being the most outstanding heavy long ranger fighter of World War II. The trouble was that it never had the opportunity to prove it. The Mitsubishi Ki-83 was designed and built by a team lead by Tomio Kubo, the designer of the highly successful Ki-46 [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. This was in response to a 1943 specification for a new heavy fighter with great range. The first four prototypes flew on November 18, 1944. Their performance was nothing short of spectacular. The machines displayed remarkable maneuverability for aircraft of their size, being able to execute a 2,200 foot diameter loop in just 31 seconds at a speed of over 400 mph. The Ki-83 carried a powerful armament of two 30 mm and two 20 mm cannon in its nose. Plans for the Ki-83 to enter into production within the bomb ravaged Japanese industrial complex were underway when the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945. The Ki-83 was a total surprise to the Americans who, unaware of its existence, had not given it a code name as they had to all known Japanese World War II aircraft. Following the war, American aeronautical engineers and American Air Force officials evaluated the four prototype machines with great interest.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fw 190 D was designed by Kurt Tank, Focke-Wulfe’s chief engineer. He intended it as an "emergency solution" to the German fighter situation until his new Ta 154 [modeled elsewhere in this collection] was available. Yet, the Fw 190 D became one of the most numerous of the many Fw 190 variants and came to be nicknamed the "Dora-Nine" by the Allies. It differed from previous Fw 190s by having an in line liquid-cooled engine that replaced the earlier Fw 190s radial engines. The airframe of earlier Fw 190s was used unchanged in the D variant, except that in order to accommodate the inline engine, the fuselage nose of the D was lengthened two feet giving the machine a distinctive long nosed appearance. The radiator for the liquid-cooled engine was annular in configuration. It was at the front of the engine ventilated by a circular fan, whose the blades can be seen immediately behind the propeller. This overall configuration gave the aircraft the appearance of having a radial engine which, of course, it did not. When introduced in August of 1944, the Fw 190 Ds were the best propeller fighters of the time with a performance unequaled by any other. Including all of its different variants and prototypes, from the end of 1939 into early 1945, a total of 20,087 Fw 190s were manufactured with a peak daily production of twenty-two being reached in early 1944. The prototype of this model was a "Dora-Nine" deployed in the defense of the Reich during the final days of Nazi Germany.]]>

<![CDATA[The Hawker Hart was the first in a long line of light biplane fighter bombers designed by Hawker’s chief engineer Sidney Camm. The Hawker Hart entered Royal Air Force service in 1930 and was faster than any other aircraft in the RAF at the time. It was so successful in its duel role as a fighter and light bomber that it inspired an entire line of subsequent machines all of that looked very similar externally and varied only in power plants and internal equipment. These subsequent aircraft included the Hart, Hind, Osprey, Demon, Audax, Hardy, Fury, Nimrod, Hector, and the Hartebeeste. This family of Hart aircraft saw extensive service in the 1930s right up to World War II. By the time of the outbreak of World War II, the Hawker Hart and its family of aircraft had almost all been relegated to training units and to duties as target tugs. A few Harts remained in combat service with the RAF and with the Royal South African Air Force as they fought the Italians in the Middle East during the early months of the war. The last Harts were declared obsolete and retired in 1943 after a career spanning over 13 years]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[The Fairchild F-91 was designed by A.A. Gassner, chief engineer of the Fairchild Company, while working closely with the Pan American Airways Company. The F-91 was of mixed metal and fabric construction with landing gear that retracted into wells in either side its flying boat style fuselage. The machine first flew in early 1935 and, after satisfactory trials, production of six aircraft began. Pan American took delivery of two of the F-91s and transferred them to its Brazilian subsidiary, Panair do Brasil, where they were used on its Amazon River routes until 1945. Pan American cancelled their order for the remaining four aircraft, which Fairchild then sold to others [including the American millionaire Gar Wood who used it until World War II erupted, whereupon he donated the machines to the British]. The British deployed it to the Eastern Mediterranean, where it served as an air-sea rescue aircraft. The details of the F-91s operational career are vague, apparently none survived the war.]]>

It was the third in a series of trainers starting with the Fn.305, all of the same basic airframe with the major differences being engine and cockpit arrangement. It was a steel tube structure with metal covering forward and fabric aft with retractable landing gear. Wing stubs were steel tube, while the outer panels were wood box spars and ribs all covered with plywood. The tail was wood framed and fabric covered. The student pilot and instructor sat in tandem in a well-glazed cockpit. The Nardi Fn.315 and its companion models were widely employed throughout Italy in multiple Regia Aeronautica flight schools during World War II.]]>

Following its introduction in 1935, it served as the principle ground attack bomber of the Red Air Force throughout the remainder of the 1930s. Production of the Polikarpov R-Z lasted for just three years, 1,031 were built between 1935 and 1937. Numbers of these aircraft were sent by the Soviet Union to the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, where they saw very active service. Some R-Zs were captured by the fascist National forces and were deployed by them in combat and used as trainers. Although being obsolete at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the R-Z remained in active combat service with the Red Air Force as a ground attack machine. With the advent of more modern ground attack aircraft, these biplanes were then relegated to the role of reconnaissance platforms, where they flew until retired in 1944.]]>

Numerous alterations and changes were required over the following months. Only a few pre-production prototypes were built because competing with the Fw 187 was the Messerschmitt Bf 110 [modeled elsewhere in this collection], which was already in full production. Since the two aircraft were intended to fulfill the same role in the Luftwaffe, the Fw 187 was never put into production. The pre-production prototypes that were already built were put into a special staffel that was assigned the task of defending the Focke-Wulf plant in Bremen, German. A few of the prototypes were later unofficially attached to operational Luftwaffe fighter units deployed in Denmark and Norway.]]>

<![CDATA[The Grumman Company designed and built the Goose for civilian sale in 1937. The machine was a high-winged monoplane with a flying boat type of fuselage. The wing mounted two engines and outrigger wing floats. Its landing gear retracted into wells on both sides of its fuselage hull. The commercial version could accommodate up to 7 passengers. The United States Navy also ordered the machines and received its first aircraft in 1939, designating them JRFs. They were used for reconnaissance, transport, target towing, and photographic roles by the Navy and Marine Corps. Several variants of the Goose were built. Some were adapted to carry bombs and depth charges. In the run up to World War II and during the conflict, a total of 184 of these machines were produced. Numbers were sent to Great Britain and Canada under the Lend-Lease Program. Following the war, a large number of these aircraft returned to civilian service, some used by an airline providing inter-island flights in the Caribbean and the Virgin Islands, as well as Alaska.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was one of the finest ground support and anti-tank machines of World War II. It was specifically designed for this role, which prior to World War II was a type of warfare that was mostly unappreciated. It was designed and first built in 1940 and from the very beginning its value was evident. The bottom of the fuselage had no less than 13 mm of steel armor protecting the engine, pilot, and fuel tanks, making the machine essentially immune from all but the heaviest caliber ground fire. Its nickname was "The Flying Tank." Its destructive power was awesome with cannon and bombs. After developmental trials, the initial Shturmoviks were single-seat aircraft. While they were safe from most ground fire, they were slower than German fighters who would attack the Il-2s from the rear with devastating effect. Thus, the second variant of the Shturmovik was altered to provide for a second crew—a gunner in the rear of the cockpit. This model, the Il-2M3, is modeled elsewhere in this collection. The Il-2 in all of its variants was very effective in the huge tank battles on the Eastern Front during the last two years of the war. The later versions of Il-2 remained in production until 1954 and in service with the Soviet Air Force and the air services of its communist Iron Curtain allies until the late 1950s. The aircraft modeled is of the early single-seat variant and is painted in white winter camouflage. Its weathering reflects heavy use. The model attempts to capture this weathering.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This small sleek biplane was in the linage of fighter aircraft built by the Fokker Aviation Company during the 1920s and 1930s. The D.XVII retained many of the features of its predecessors, features that were so common to fighter aircraft of the era—biplane configuration with inter-plane struts and bracing, open cockpit, and a light armament of only two rifle caliber machine guns—features that were not much different from the fighters of World War I. Deliveries of the new machines to the LVA began in October of 1932. Numbers of these fighters were shipped to the Netherlands’s colonies in the Dutch East Indies. Fokker D.XVIIs remained with active LVA fighter squadrons into the late 1930s primarily in Europe, the East Indies aircraft having been returned to the Netherlands in late 1936. By the outbreak of World War II, the Fokker D.XVIIs were hopelessly obsolete and had been largely relegated to training units of the Royal Dutch Air Force. In May of 1940, when Germany invaded the Low Countries, most of the operational Fokker D.XVIIs were destroyed on the ground at their airdromes by attacking German aircraft. World War II records, however, indicate that at least seven surviving Fokker D.XVII aircraft saw some limited combat service during the brief German invasion of the Netherlands, although they were no match for the modern German fighters they were forced to confront. No Fokker D.XVIIs are known to have survived the war.]]>

</displayedAs>
<history>
<![CDATA[This aircraft was originally designed by the Bristol Aircraft Company in response to a 1938 British Air Ministry specification for a new high performance twin-engine medium bomber. However, for various reasons, the responsibility for the subsequent building of the bomber was transferred to the Armstrong Whitworth Company under the leadership of that firm’s engineer John Lloyd. The machine was constructed of steel framing covered with plywood. Tail and control surfaces were canvas covered. The prototype’s maiden flight was in mid 1939, just prior to the outbreak of World War II, but the machine crashed. The second prototype flew on March 20, 1940. The Air Ministry’s performance specifications for the new bomber were never achieved and only 42 out of the total production of 602 Albemarle aircraft were ever deployed as bombers and even these were quickly converted to other roles. Many were used as paratrooper transports, with an ability to carry ten fully-equipped soldiers. Others were used as fast transports and were given the designation "ST." However, the machines’ most noteworthy role was when they were deployed as tugs for the large British Airspeed Horsas attack gliders [modeled elsewhere in this collection]. These tugs were given the designation "GT." Albemarle aircraft saw extensive action in the invasions of Sicily [July 1943], the D-Day invasions of Normandy [June 1944] and in towing gliders carrying troops of the British 1st Airborne Division into the ill-fated battle at Arnhem [September 1944]. Six Albemarle aircraft of No. 295 Squadron acted as pathfinders for paratrooper airdrops of the British 6th Airborne Division during the D-Day invasions on June 6, 1944. Fourteen of these machines were transported to the Soviet Union in 1943 as a gift from the British Royal Family. Production of Albemarle aircraft ended in December of 1944. Although they failed in their originally intended role, Albemarle aircraft made a substantial contribution to the Allied war effort.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[Except for a single tragic episode in which it was involved, this rather unattractive box-shaped utility transport would have received little or no attention in the history books of World War II. The fog was very heavy on the night of December 15, 1944, when the famous band leader Major Glenn Miller, along with his pilot, departed from England in a C-64 Norseman bound for Paris. Glenn Miller was to join his orchestra there for an extended entertainment tour of American military bases throughout newly liberated France. However, the plane never arrived. Extensive searches failed to find the aircraft or its wreckage, leading authorities to conclude that it crashed either into the English Channel or the North Sea. Several theories have been put forward, but the actual cause of the aircraft’s disappearance will never be known. The Norseman was large for a single engine aircraft. A high-wing monoplane, it was built by the Canadian firm Noorduyn Aviation Ltd. based in Montreal. Intended for both civilian and military markets, it was designed as a passenger transport for operating in the harsh Canadian winters. The Norseman could be fitted with wheels, skis, or pontoons giving it a "go anywhere at any time capability." It first flew on November 14, 1935, and initially received limited interest, but with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Royal Canadian Air Force bought numbers of Norseman as did the United States when it entered the War just over two years later. The Army Air Force Transport Command gave them the designation C-64, the Army Corps of Engineers UC-64B, and the Navy JA-1. Of the several Norseman variants built during World War II, the Mk V [modeled here] was built in the largest numbers. Some 749 were purchased by the United States during the war and they were deployed widely throughout the continental United Sates and Europe. They were very frequent sightings on almost all United States military airdromes.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[This flying boat was the only World War II military aircraft that could trace its ancestry directly back to a machine that had been operationally active in World War I. The Hall PH-3 flying boat of World War II [modeled here] was of the same basic design and little different from the British Felixstowe F-5 flying boat of 1917. The Felixstowe F-5 had been extremely successful and had remained in service with British Coastal Command into the late 1920s. The United States Naval Aircraft Factory was created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after World War I. Its mission was to design, test, and build aircraft for the United States Navy. In 1922, it designed and built a flying boat that was nearly identical to the WWI British Felixstowe of 1917. The new machine retained the biplane configuration, the extensive inter-wing struts, and the multitude of bracing wires of its forbearer. It also retained the Felixstowe’s boat-like fuselage. However, unlike its predecessor, the PH-3 was given a closed crew cockpit and, in place of the older planes' liquid-cooled inline engines, the new Hall HP-3 was given more powerful and modern radial engines. It first flew successfully in December of 1929, but the production capacity of the Naval Aircraft factory was very limited, so the manufacture of its new flying boat was contracted out to four different American aircraft firms [Douglas, Martin, Keystone, and the Hall Aluminum Aircraft Corporation]. It was the latter firm that built the penultimate variant of the series and the one that was produced in the greatest numbers. In recognition of its builder, it was designated the Naval Aircraft Factory/Hall PH-3. Fourteen Hall PH-3 flying boats were purchased by the United States Coast Guard in the late 1930s. Upon the entry of the United States into World War II, they were armed and assigned to anti-submarine patrols operating from Coast Guard stations at Miami, Elizabeth City, Brooklyn, Biloxi, San Diego, and San Francisco. The Hall PH-3s remained in Coast Guard service until late 1944, when they were replaced by more modern aircraft.]]>

<history>
<![CDATA[In 1934, the British Ministry of Air submitted a specification for a new aircraft to replace the Royal Air Force’s obsolete Vickers Valentia that had entered service in 1925 as both a bomber and a transport. The Bristol Aviation Company responded to the specification with a rather large, twin-engine, fixed under-carriage, high-wing monoplane that they called the Bristol Bombay. Like its predecessor, it also was created for a duel role—bomber or transport. The Bombay made a satisfactory maiden flight on June 23, 1935, and after military flight testing at its Martlesham Health facility, the Royal Air Force placed a production order for fifty of the new machines. At the time, the Bristol Company was heavily involved in the manufacture of its Blenheim medium bomber [modeled elsewhere in this collection], necessitating transfer of production of the Bombay to the aviation firm Short & Harland based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The first Royal Air Force unit to be equipped with the Bombay was No. 216 Squadron operating in Egypt. It received its Bombay aircraft in September of 1939 shortly after the outbreak of World War II. Some weeks later, No. 267 and No. 271 Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, also based in the Middle East, received Bombay aircraft. Although they were few in numbers, the type saw extensive service in the duel bomber and transport role during the Libyan campaign of 1940. Bombay aircraft also participated in the first airborne deployment of paratroops in the North African theater of operations. Further, a Bristol Bombay evacuated the Greek Royal Family from Crete to Egypt just prior to that island’s capture by the Germans. As the War progressed, it became obvious that the concept of an aircraft effectively performing as both a bomber and a transport was outdated. Thus, during the latter months of their operational duties, which were almost entirely confined to the Middle East, Bombay aircraft were employed only as transports. They were all finally replaced in 1943 with superior and more modern transport aircraft. Britain’s standard camouflage colors for those Royal Air Force aircraft operating in the Middle East was a combination of desert sand and earth on the upper surfaces with sky blue on the under surfaces. But it was not long before the area’s sandy desert environment caused extensive exterior paint disruption and weathering. This model attempts to replicate the appearance of a Bombay that served under these conditions.]]>
