# Holtgrewe Interactive

Project to modernize the Holtgrewe Interactive exhibit from the Museum of Flight.

The WWI Holtgrewe model database interactive is displayed in the
Personal Courage Wing, yet it using obsolute technology that is
no longer widely supported.

## Project Goals

- Collect original media files and content from the Flash-based
  interactive exhibit.
- Verify complete via running a Flash Emulator (e.g., [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)).
- Decompile the elements from the Flash file(s) to extract all the
  original media that was used (e.g., using
  [JEPXS Flash decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)).
- Build a modern version of the application in HTML/CSS/Javascript that
  can be run on modern browsers (desktop, mobile, or kiosk modes).
