    "title": "Ph\u00f6nix D.IIa",
    "history": "The Ph\u00f6nix D.IIa was the last in the series of fighter aircraft designed and built by the Austro-Hungarian firm Ph\u00f6nix Flugzeugwerke that were deployed in operational combat during World War I. The design work was completed by Ph\u00f6nix's chief engineer, Edmund Sparmann. The machine borrowed much from its predecessor, the Ph\u00f6nix D.I and externally the two looked much alike. Although widely used by the Austro-Hungarian Air Force, pilots often complained that the Ph\u00f6nix D.I was overweight for its power plant, giving the aircraft only mediocre performance. \n\nTo produce a better fighter, Sparmann designed the D.II variant. While having the same 200 hp Hiero engine as the D.I, the D.II was lightened by nearly 176 lbs. Weight was removed from the fighter through the alteration of its internal wood framing and its fuselage. The wings and tail surfaces were also lightened. The result was a marked improvement in the fighter's aerodynamic handling. For even better performance, Sparmann and his engineer colleague, Ing Kirste, upgraded the D.II's power plant to a 230 hp engine, thus creating the Phoniz D.IIa (modeled here). Shortages of the 230 hp Hiero engines required that some 20% of the D.IIa fighters be delivered with the smaller Hiero 200 hp power plants. But even these smaller 200 hp D.IIa fighters were clearly superior to their predecessor, the D.I. \n\nThe new D.IIa aircraft began supplying Austro-Hungarian fighter units in late May of 1918 and remained in operational service with both the Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy until the end of the War. While probably the best fighter built by the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I, the D.IIa was not the equal of the newer Albatros or Fokker fighters in service with the German Air Force during 1918. Neither was it equal to the S.P.A.D. and Sopwith fighters flying for the Allies.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The factory fresh Ph\u00f6nix D.IIa modeled here was the machine flown during the final days of World War I on the Austro-Hungarian/Italian front by the Austrian pilot Karf Teichmann.",

    "history": "As the dominance of the Fokker monoplanes began to wane in the face of new and improved machines, Anthony Fokker instructed designer, Martin Kreutzer to begin work on a biplane fighter. One of the designs Kreutzer developed was the M.17E. While the German military showed little interest in The Fokker M.17, a number of the biplanes were sold to Austria-Hungary, which re-designated the aircraft, the B.III.\n\nThe B.III was constructed of canvas-covered wood framing except for a metal cowling about its rotary engine. The small aircraft employed wing warping for lateral control and the vast majority of the machines were unarmed. Some evidence indicates that at least one B.III (modeled here) was equipped with a machine gun, though there are conflicting reports as to the weapon's placement and type.\n\nMost B.IIIs were employed as reconnaissance scouts or trainers, though the prototype for this model was reportedly flown on the Eastern Front as a fighter by Oberleutnant, Plus Moosbrugger.

    "title": "Zeppelin L 30",
    "history": "The Zeppelin L 30, modeled here, was chosen to represent Germany's fleet of wartime airships within this collection. It was the first of seventeen R-class \"super-Zeppelins\"-a class of airships larger than earlier machines which could carry larger bomb loads and could fly higher and faster. \n\nFive decades before the outbreak of World War I, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, an officer in the Prussian Calvary, ventured to the United States to serve as an Army observer during the American Civil War. There, he witnessed tethered balloons being used for battlefield observation. Deeply impressed, he returned to Germany where he began the development of the world's first rigid and propeller driven airships. So profound was the Count's influence that the name Zeppelin was commonly applied to all such aircraft. \n\nThough originally designed for civilian transport purposes, Zeppelins were soon adapted for military use. With the outbreak of World War I, many civilian airships were pressed into service. After initial sorties as tactical bombers and observation platforms proved impractical, Zeppelins were instead assigned to bomb civilian population centers, particularly London and Paris. The Zeppelin raids on these cities during World War I mark some of the first examples of strategic bombing missions -attacks against population centers intended to disrupt industry and demoralize an enemy.\n\nLifted by multiple gas cells filled with flammable hydrogen, Zeppelins primarily relied on their ability to climb above the range of enemy aircraft and ground fire. While early raids encountered little resistance, the British and French soon modified selected fighters to fly higher and armed their machine guns with incendiary bullets. Hydrogen filled Zeppelins began to be shot from the sky in flames. Zeppelin bombing raids were also largely conducted at night, but even though they were painted black for stealth, their huge size made them easy targets.\n\nSuper Zeppelins like the L 30 were developed in an effort to stay ahead of Allied defensive capabilities by climbing ever higher. Unfortunately, the continued advancement of aircraft technology met the airships step for step. Nevertheless, the L 30 had a long and successful career. It conducted 31 reconnaissance flights and 9 raids over England and was one of the few German airships to survive the war unscathed. After the War ended, Zeppelin L 30 was seized by the Allies and delivered to Belgium for examination.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The building of this Zeppelin L 30 model was a collaboration between Dr. H. Logan Holtgrewe, and Museum of Flight volunteer, Mr. Alex \"Sandy\" Morton. The  Zeppelin model was built entirely from scratch in 1/48 scale (one inch of the model equals 4 feet of the prototype) -the same scale as all the fixed wing aircraft models. This sameness of scale allows the viewer to appreciate the relative size of the various aircraft represented and to appreciate the huge size of the  Zeppelin L30. The illuminated gondola's overhead white lights allow the viewer to see the airship's interior details. Such lighting would have been extinguished during bombing raids over enemy territory being replaced by dim red night lights -this was to enhance nighttime stealth.",

Other countries, however, utilized the HDs during the war. The Italian Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nieuport-Macchi company built many under license, and the HD 1 became the standard fighter of the Italian Air Force. The Belgian Air Force also flew the HD 1. Belgium's leading World War I ace Willy Coppens scored most of his 37 victories in this aircraft. The United States also purchased 10 of the HD 2s when it entered the war in 1917. They were flown from the United States Navy Facility at Dunkerque, France, in a reconnaissance-fighter role.\n\nAfter the war, many of the HD 2s remained in service with the United States Navy Air Service. The Naval Aircraft Factory replaced the floats with wheels, and the planes became trainers at Langley Field. One of these wheeled versions participated in early United States Navy experiments involving aircraft flights from ships.

While large numbers of Nieuport 17s were built in France, the Nieuport-Macchi company in Italy also constructed them under license. The Nieuport 17 retained the characteristic sesquiplane wing of the previous Nieuport crafts (including the Nieuports 10, 11, and 16). This sesquiplane design made the Nieuport 17 one of the most maneuverable aircraft of the period. The Nieuport 17 was slightly larger than the Nieuport 11, had a larger engine, and included a synchronized machine gun that fired through the propeller. \n\nThe Nieuport 17 entered the war on the Western Front early in 1916.

    "title": "Morane-Saulnier Type AI",
    "history": "The Morane-Saulnier Type AI was an aircraft which tested very well, but which ended up with a very short operational career. The AI was a high-winged monoplane, constructed from metal and spruce. The primary wing braces were further supported by auxiliary struts attached mid-span. This arrangement proved to be very sturdy and would be reflected in the company's post-war designs. The Morane-Saulnier Type AI made its first test flights in August of 1917. The aircraft's performance at these tests was looked upon favorably and the Aviation Militaire placed an order for between 1,100 and 1,300 Type AIs, which arrived at combat escadrilles beginning in early 1918.\n\nDespite the favorable trials and large number of aircraft purchased for service, the Type AI only served in combat operations for a couple of months. Deliveries of production aircraft began in March of 1918. But by late May of that same year the Morane-Saulnier Type AIs had all been withdrawn from combat status and relegated to training duties at French flight schools. The reason for the rapid withdrawal of these aircraft is still unclear. One theory suggests that problems with the Gnome engine were to blame, while another suggests that structural weaknesses may have been the cause. Training versions of the Type AI replaced the Gnome engine with 120-135hp Le Rh\u00f4ne engines and a dedicated trainer variant was built with additional wing braces.",

The Nie.11 was one of the outstanding landmarks in the evolution of fighter aircraft. The machine was built in very large numbers in France by its parent company, in Italy under license by Nieuport-Macchi and in Russia under license by Dux. It was a smaller refinement of its immediate predecessor the Nieuport X. A sesquiplane, its upper wing had twice the surface area of its lower wing. The Nie.11 was constructed of wood framing covered with fabric except for the forward fuselage and engine cowling which were covered with thin aluminum sheet. The aircraft's small size led to the acquisition of its nickname, \"B\u00e9b\u00e9\" (baby). \n\nThe Nie.11 entered service with the Aviation Militaire on January 5, 1916 at a time when the French had not yet developed synchronization between a fighter's forward firing machine gun and its propeller. Thus, the Nie.11's single machine gun was mounted atop the upper wing firing over its propeller arc. By the time of the battle of Verdun, which began on February 21, 1916, nine French Fighter Escadrilles were equipped with Nie.11s. \n\nThe fighter proved to be fast, maneuverable and more than a match for the German Fokker and Pfalz \"Eindeckers\" (monoplanes), which were creating what Allied airman called the \"Eindecker scourge\". For several months the Nie.11 brought air superiority to the Allies. Some of France's most famous aces (Guynemer, De Rosa and Nungesser, among others) scored early victories while flying the Nie.11. \n\nIn addition to equipping French fighter units, the Nie.11 was deployed by the air forces of Great Britain (modeled here), Belgium, Russia, Romania, Serbia, the Netherlands and the Ukraine. American volunteer pilots, flying for France before the entry of the United States into the war, formed, within the Aviation Militaire, the famous Lafayette Escadrille. They also flew the Nieuport 11. \n\nAlthough it remained in active service with the Italians until the late summer of 1917, by mid-summer 1916 it was being replaced on the Western Front by its faster and better armed successor, the Nieuport 17. Following their withdrawal from active combat, Nie.11s were employed as trainers by various Allied Air Forces.",

In 1918, S.I.A. became Fiat-Aviazione and produced the R.2 as its first aircraft under the new brand. Intended as an armed reconnaissance aircraft, the R.2 was essentially a redesign of the earlier S.I.A. 7.B 2. Fiat engineer, Celestino Rosatelli, developed the new aircraft in an effort to correct the structural problems suffered by the earlier 7.B 2.\n\nLike its predecessor, the R.2 was based around the Fiat A12 six-cylinder inline liquid-cooled engine. The aircraft's framing was a mixture of wood and steel tubing. Sheet metal surrounded the forward fuselage and totally enclosed the engine. While the earlier 7.B 2 had plywood covering over its entire fuselage, the new B.2 replaced the heavier wood with fabric over the rear part of the fuselage. The center of the R.2's upper wing was strengthened to improve its structural integrity, but retained the general shape and unusual top-wing gap of its predecessor. \n\nAfter the new machine's flight trials, an order for 500 aircraft was placed with Fiat. Large-scale production of the R.2 did not begin until autumn of 1918. Nevertheless, 129 of the aircraft were completed by the time of the Armistice with a number having flown in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, less than a month before.",

The new machine needed to be light in relation to its power plant in order to carry the substantial weight of a naval torpedo. With this in mind, the Cuckoo was designed to seat a single pilot, to carry no defensive armament. The aircraft's construction consisted of light wood framing with fabric covering -except for a metal cowling about the engine. The Cuckoos' wings folded back along the fuselage to accommodate the confined spaces on the aircraft carrier's flight deck. The new torpedo bomber also had an arresting tail hook to assist in landing on a carrier's flight deck. \n\nFollowing satisfactory prototype trials in the spring of 1918, the Admiralty ordered 150 of the new T.1 Cuckoos. Only 90 had been delivered to squadrons of the Royal Naval Air Service by the War's end on November 11, 1918. Given the revolutionary and complicated nature of the Cuckoos' shipboard operations, their pilots were all still undergoing familiarization training trials at the time of the armistice. As such, none ever launched a torpedo in anger. Nonetheless, the Sopwith T.1 Cuckoo is historically important as the world's first shipboard torpedo bomber. This aircraft type would become a major factor in the naval engagements of World War II. World War I historical records do not explain how the Sopwith T.1 acquired the nickname \"Cuckoo\".",

    "history": "The Albatros W.4 fulfilled the need for a German Naval fighter to counter the British flying boats in the North and Baltic Seas. Inspired by the earlier Albatros D.I and D.II, the W.4 retained the fuselage and the power plant of the Albatros D.II, but included new wings and tail structures. Twin floats replaced the wheels to equip it for marine operations. Fabric covered the majority of the fighter's wooden frame, except for the engine housing and floats, which were covered with thin metal sheeting. \n\nDesign flaws plagued early W.4s. A transparent Cellon panel, mounted in the center upper wing section to improve the pilot's vision, proved to be brittle and prone to tearing off in flight. These were soon replaced by traditional fabric. The W.4 also experienced problems with its engine's two radiators. The radiators, which were uniquely positioned on either side of the fuselage, often boiled over in warm weather. Later versions of the W.4 switched to a single flush mounted radiator located in the center of the upper wing. This arrangement proved to be more satisfactory.\n\nThe German Air Force employed the W.4 to counter naval reconnaissance and U-boat hunting missions conducted by British flying boats in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. World War I records are vague about the success or failure of the operations of the W.4. With 128 machines built in all, it can be assumed that they were reasonably successful. At the War's end, various seaplane stations on the Baltic coast still listed 65 of these machines in active service.",

Designed by Ernst Heinkel, chief designer for Albatroswerke GmbH, the new C.III resembled its predecessor with a number of refinements. The C.III was slightly smaller than its predecessor, but was equipped with the same 150 or 160 h.p. power plant, resulting in better speed and rate of climb. Like the C.I, the C.III had wood framing. The fuselage was covered with a thin varnished plywood veneer, the wings and tail with doped fabric. Metal sheet surrounded the forward fuselage and engine. \n\nFlight trials of the new C.III in late 1915 were highly successful and the machine was immediately placed into mass production with its operational deployment beginning in the first weeks of 1916. Demand for the C.III was so great that in addition to its parent company it was also built under license by several other German firms. After reaching the Front, the C.III served with great distinction. Allied pilots found it robust and difficult to shoot down. Later deliveries of the C.III were also fitted with a propeller-synchronized machine gun, making the C.III the first two-gun operational C-type (German armed reconnaissance aircraft) and further adding to its defensive capability.\n\nIn the early summer of 1917 the C.III began to be replaced by a series of more advanced Albatros C-types. Albatros. Yet of all these C-type variants, the C.III was built in the greatest numbers and was deployed by the most units of the German Air Force. \n\nFollowing its withdrawal from frontline service the machine continued to be manufactured. Unarmed and fitted with dual controls, these later C.IIIs were widely used as trainers at German flight schools. Their deployment in this role continued until the war\u2019s end. Of all Germany\u2019s World War I C-type aircraft built by Albatros and other German manufacturers, the Albatros C.III was one of the most ubiquitous and most successful.",

In early production models, the engine was completely enclosed in a circular cowling. However, persistent cooling problems lead designers to remove a large portion of the lower cowling in later units (such as the one modeled here) in an effort to improve airflow. \n\nThe first prototype D.III flew in January, 1918 with production models arriving on the Western front later that spring. The D.III exhibited an excellent climb rate and the Sh III engine maintained its power well at high altitudes. However, the D.IIIs' speed in level flight was only 112.5 mph (180 km/hr). As a result, the machines were largely assigned to interceptor duties. Further attempts to improve engine performance and speed resulted in the new D.IV variant.\n\nThe Siemens-Schuckert fighters remained in production until almost a year after hostilities ceased.

    "history": "Russian Aircraft Designer, Igor Sikorsky originally developed the <i>Il'ya Muromets</i> as a large transport aircraft. Named for a popular Russian folk hero, the <i>Il'ya Muromets</i> was a massive four-engined biplane built by the Russian Baltic Railroad Car Factory (R-BVZ) and came complete with an enclosed cockpit and passenger cabin. The transport version, officially designated S-22 <i>Il'ya Muromets</i> B, flew a series of demonstration flights in the late spring and early summer of 1914 to drum up interest.\n\nWhen World War I began, a number of SS-22 B transports were delivered to the Imperial Russian Army, and a new order was placed for a version modified to serve as a bomber. The new bomber, designated S-23 V included more windows in the cockpit to improve the pilot's view. It also utilized a different fuel tank configuration. Rather than individual tanks suspended above each engine, the bomber version used two large fuel tanks tucked between the top of the fuselage and the upper wing.\n\nSince Russia had no aircraft engines, the power plants, including Argus, Sunbeam, Salmson and Renault, were all imported from European suppliers. However, production delays often forced the Russian military to scavenge engines from crashed or retired aircraft. This lack of adequate engines plagued the entire line of bombers. \n\nAfter their first bombing raid on February 15, 1915 the Sikorsky <i>Il'ya Muromets</i> flew more than 400 missions against Prussia and Germany and remained in active combat service until the Russian Revolution of 1917 ended their participation in World War I.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The nose & fuel tank configuration in this model resemble those used in the B-type transport aircraft.

    "history": "The Grahame-White Box-kite was first developed in 1912 by Claude Grahame-White, founder of Britain's first flying school at Hendon. The aircraft served as a trainer for students at the school before being converted for military use. The Box-Kite appeared in several different variants as time progressed and there is some debate as to how that progression should be characterized. Some scholars refer to the Box-Kite as the predecessor to the Grahame-White Type XII and Type XV, while others state that all the variants of the machine were eventually renamed to the Type XV.\n\nThe earliest version of the aircraft resembled the Farman biplane of 1909. It included both fore and aft elevators, a pusher engine and was controlled from an exposed position directly over the mid-point of the lower wing. Later variants, like the one modeled here, included a pilot's nacelle, more powerful engines and wings with a staggered span.\n\nIn November of 1913, a Box-kite piloted by Marcus Manton participated in an air-firing test at Bisley, England. The plane was equipped with a Lewis machine gun and the gunner, Lieutenant Stellingwerf, successfully managed to hit ground targets during two passes of the target range, thus demonstrating the potential for the airplane as a weapon of war.\n\nThe Grahame-White XV began equipping flight schools for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service in December of 1913 and served as a basic training aircraft. The Grahame-White Type XV modeled here is based on a late variant in the series -likely from 1916. The aircraft depicted was based at the Royal Flying Corps aerodrome at Hendon, north of London. \n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model incorporates a compilation of features from several Grahame-White variants. The pilot nacelle and staggered wings suggest it is a later model, but the large anti-nose-over skids on the aircraft's undercarriage were mostly used in early versions.

    "history": "In early 1916, the German Navy issued a specification for a seaplane defensive fighter. The German firm Hansa-Brandenburg based at Warnemunde-Rostock responded with the Brandenburg KDW. The new seaplane was essentially a modified version of an existing land based fighter -the Hansa-Brandenberg D.I. \n\nThe land-based D.I was deployed almost exclusively by Germany's ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although reasonably fast, the D.I had experienced very limited success. The aircraft suffered from poor stability and flight qualities, which rendered it inferior to its Allied opposition. Except for two pontoons in place of wheels, the new KDW shared the same construction as the D.I. Like its predecessor, the KDW utilized a unique system of intra-wing struts with four sets of triangular posts meeting at their apex giving the struts a \"star-like\" appearance. This arrangement eliminated the need for additional bracing wires thus reducing wind resistance and, like it did for the D.I, gave the KDW excellent speed. However, the KDW also inherited the D.I's poor stability and handling, which were only made worse by the added weight of its pontoons. \n\nWhen KDW seaplanes became operational in late 1916, they were able to engage reconnaissance seaplanes and large slow moving bombers with a reasonable chance of success, but they were at a distinct disadvantage in combat with contemporary land-based fighters. KDW No. 748, modeled here was the first prototype built, but records indicate it also saw operational service. This particular aircraft was based at the German Seaplane facility at Angernsee. The KDW's finest moment occurred on September 23, 1916 when No. 748 flown by Lieutenant Fritz Hammer engaged a Russian Sikorsky Ilya Muromets heavy bomber. Making repeated passes, Hammer severely damaged the bomber, forcing it to crash land in a nearby meadow. During all of World War I only two of Sikorsky's giant bombers were ever shot down, making this air victory a very historical event. \n\nThe KDW was eventually replaced by the Albatros W.4 -another German seaplane fighter- which had far superior flight capabilities and armament. Of the nearly 2,500 aircraft deployed by the German Naval Air Service during the War, only 58 were Brandenburg KDWs.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts a KDW equipped with a chimney-style exhaust stack.

These modifications provided better forward and upward visibility for the pilot. The D.II was designed by Herren Thelen, Schbert and Gnadig, three aeronautical engineers with Albatroswerke GmbH. The D.II was built not only by its parent company but also under license by the German company LVG (Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft). \n\nAlbatros D.IIs arrived on the Western Front in November 1916. By January 1917, over 200 had joined the fighter units of the Central Powers. To counter the D.IIs, the Allies introduced their new fighters - French SPADs and Nieuports and the new British Sopwiths. In turn, the Germans produced their new Albatros D.IIIs and Vs and Fokker fighters. These newer machines out-performed the older Albatros D.IIs, which were gradually withdrawn from frontline fighter units. \n\nAfter the withdrawal of the D.IIs, Germany sent many of these now-surplus machines to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Air Force needed an aircraft to patrol the vast desert areas of the empire and to control British-backed Arab insurgencies. After a small modification, the D.II served this purpose. The original design of the D.II featured two radiators located one on each side of the forward fuselage. Operating in desert heat, these radiators would often boil over. To avoid this, the dual radiators were replaced by a single flush mounted radiator placed in the center of the upper wing.\n\nThe historical records of World War I are unclear about the success or failure of the D.IIs while serving with the Ottoman Air Force in the Middle East.

    "history": "The design and construction of the Lloyd C.V began in early 1916. The Austrian aircraft company Ungarische Lloyd Flugzeug und Motorenfabrik developed the Lloyd C.V as an armed reconnaissance aircraft for spotting and controlling artillery fire. Some of these machines included early wireless radios for communicating with the ground artillery units for which they were spotting.\n\nThe Lloyd C.V included a number of unusual features. While most aircraft of the era were covered with a doped fabric, the Lloyd C.V's wings and fuselage were covered with a skin of fine wood veneer. This resulted in an aerodynamically efficient surface but led to condensation problems within the sealed wing structures. Condensation caused the wing structure to warp. \n\nEfforts to correct this problem never fully resolved the issue. The radiator for the aircraft's liquid-cooled engine was placed immediately behind the propeller in the direct line of the pilot's forward vision. As a result, the pilot was forced to lean out the side of the cockpit in order to see ahead during flight. Some Lloyd C.Vs (like the one modeled here) also included a \"coffin-like\" structure on the top of their upper wing, which housed a fixed forward firing machine gun. While the placement of the machine gun on the top of the upper wing was common among early World War I aircraft the addition of a surrounding enclosure was not. \n\nLloyd C.Vs saw extensive service as reconnaissance aircraft with the Central Powers on the Eastern Front before Russia's withdrawal from World War I. Due to a relatively short range of operation they saw less use on the Western Front and because of poor performance at high altitudes; they saw very little service on the mountainous Italian Front. At the height of their service, 12 Fliks (squadrons) of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force were equipped with the Lloyd C. V.

The Voisin 3's undercarriage was laid out in an unusual four wheeled arrangement, which gave the machine a level horizontal stance when resting on the ground. This afforded the pilot greatly enhanced forward visibility compared to more traditional \"tail dragging\" aircraft. The Voisin 3 was also one of the first aircraft to be fitted with armament -in this case, a machine gun on a flexible mount in front of the forward cockpit. These features combined to make the Voisin 3 one of the heaviest aircraft in service during the early months of World War I. \n\nAt the outbreak of war, numbers of Voisin 3 were among the 138 airworthy flying machines within the inventory of the Aviation Militaire and over 800 were eventually deployed by the French. The Voisin 3 became the standard bomber of the Aviation Militaire during the first two years of the War and was deployed in both daytime and nighttime bombing sorties. It was also the first French aircraft to achieve an air victory when, on October 5, 1914, a Voisin 3 shot down a German Aviatik biplane.  In addition to those bombers flown by France, over 100 Voisin 3s were flown by the British Royal Flying Corps and over 30 were flown by both the Belgian and Russian Air Forces. The Italian firm Societa Italinia Transaerea also built over 100 under license; these were supplied to the Italian Air Force. In total, well over 1,000 of the bombers saw service during the early stages of World War I, making the Voisin 3 one the most ubiquitous of all aircraft types flying during that period of the conflict.",

    "title": "Gotha G.V",
    "history": "The Gotha twin-engine bombers entered service in 1916 just as the German High Command realized that using large, slow-moving Zeppelins for bombing missions over England was no longer practical. The Gotha G.IV and G.V (modeled here) bombers represented a viable replacement for the airships. The Gotha bombers proved so successful that all German twin-engine bombers were commonly called \"Gotha\" regardless of their manufacturer.\n\nThe G.IV and G.V differed little in their appearance and configuration. The chief difference between the two was the location of their fuel tanks -the IV's were located in the bottom of the engine nacelles, while the V's were in the center of the fuselage. The shift to the fuselage was to reduce the risk of fire due to the proximity of engine heat.\n\nThe Gotha machines included unique defensive armament modifications. Metal screens were mounted on either side of the rear gun position to prevent the gunner from accidentally shooting into the machine's \"pusher\" propellers. Gothas also had a \"gun tunnel\" the bottom of the rear fuselage immediately behind the gun position. This opening allowed the rear gunner to defend the traditional \"blind spot\"- that area behind and below the aircraft.\n\nThe first Gotha daylight raids on England began on May 25, 1917 and continued until September. During a single raid on June 13, 1917, Gotha G.V bombers dropped nearly 4,536 kg (10,000 pounds) of bombs on London killing 162 and wounding another 450 and causing great consternation among the British public. Early Gotha daylight raids experienced little opposition, but as Allied warning systems, anti-aircraft ground fire and fighter aircraft defenses improved, they began sustaining serious losses. Gotha operations were then shifted to night raids when opposition was less formidable.\n\nOverall, the Gotha bombers were quite successful in creating discomfort among Allied civilian populations, especially Londoners. They were deployed in this role until the War's end.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> German daytime bombers were often painted in a light blue color, night bombers in a dark lozenge pattern.

Upon its entry into service, the new Salmson machine quickly replaced the older British-designed Sopwith 11/2 Strutters and the French built Farman, Breguet and Dorand machines, which had previously constituted the majority of the reconnaissance aircraft deployed  by the French. \n\nDesigned in 1917 by the French aviation Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Moteurs Salmson, the aircraft entered service with the Aviation Militaire at the beginning of 1918. By the War's end, eleven months later, over 3,200 had been manufactured by Salmson and under license by several other French companies. The aircraft equipped no fewer than 28 French reconnaissance escadrille and some 705 of the aircraft were in service with units of the United States Army Air Force. \n\nThe aircraft was essentially designed around the Salmson 9 cylinder 230 hp liquid-cooled radial piston engine. The machine's circular radiator was positioned immediately behind the propeller in front of the engine, giving the power-plant complex a very compact and aerodynamically efficient configuration. Not only was the Salmson 2 A2 a fine reconnaissance platform, but its aerodynamic properties and armament made it relatively competitive as a fighter or light bomber. \n\nOverall, the Salmson 2 A2 was a highly successful and respected aircraft.

The C.II was constructed of standard wood framing. The cockpit was enclosed in plywood, while the rear fuselage, wings and tail surface were covered with doped fabric. This model depicts an aircraft with sheeting extending back past the cockpit. While some references hint that some LVG aircraft may have been configured with similar \"armor\", it is unclear if such a configuration was ever applied to a C.II. \n\nPerhaps the LVG line's most famous moment occurred on November 28, 1916 when a specially fitted machine flew over London and dropped six 22 lb bombs on Victory Station. Some records indicate that the aircraft involved was a C.II, while others cite it as a later C.IV model. All the LVG variants appeared similar externally, differing only in their power plants and in their internal framing. This makes it difficult for historians to distinguish between model types, and as such, considerable discrepancies exist between sources. While the attack caused considerable civilian panic and consternation, it caused little damage. \n\nLVG C type aircraft, of all variants, remained in front line service until the War's end.

Frank Barnwell designed this aircraft with a drag-reducing propeller spinner, few bracing wires to detract from the aircraft's speed and performance, and a smooth, aerodynamic fuselage. Barnwell also discard the wing warping method of lateral control used in previous monoplanes in favor of standard aileron control. These features created an aircraft capable of speeds up to 132 mph.\n\nDespite its attributes, the British showed little interest in the 125 Bristol M.1Cs, perhaps stemming from a bias against monoplanes. Two other monoplane fighters were used in the war by the French and British, but neither of these achieved much acceptance with their respective air forces. The British War Office largely delegated its Bristol M.1Cs to a training role. No British Royal Flying Corps squadrons operating in France were equipped with the Bristol M.1C aircraft. The RFC No. 150 Squadron, however, flew 35 of these machines in Salonika, Greece. Still, most of the Bristol M.1Cs not sent to the Middle East spent the war as trainers, and their speed and performance were not used to their full potential.",

    "history": "The Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter was the first British fighter to have a machine gun synchronized to fire forward through its propeller arc. Designed and built by the Sopwith Aviation Company, it acquired the name of \"1 1/2 Strutter\" from its characteristic W shaped cabane wing struts. Though the name was originally unofficial, the Royal Navy Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps later adopted the name after it entered common usage. \n\nTwo variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter existed -the two-seat fighter modeled here and a single-seat light bomber. The bomber version eliminated the rear crew position in order to carry a bomb load within the machine's fuselage. A total of 1,513 of both variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter were built in Great Britain during World War I. British demand for the machines eventually exceeded the ability of its parent company to supply the needed aircraft. Other companies began to manufacture it under license, including the British firms Fairey; Morgan & Co.; Hooper; Westland; Vickers; Mann & Egerton; and Ruston & Proctor. Several French aviation companies also built both the two seat fighter and the single seat bomber version under license. A total of 4,497 of both variants were manufactured by the French, more than three times the number built by the British. \n\nIn the spring of 1916, British fighter units in the Royal Navy Air Service began flying the 1 1/2 Strutter. Later the Royal Flying Corps also ordered the machine to use on the Western Front. However, by the close of 1916, the 1 1/2 Strutter was becoming obsolete and by the middle of 1917 most of the British machines were being withdrawn from frontline combat service. \n\nThe French continued to employ numbers of the aircraft well into 1918 and sold some of the French-built 1 1/2 Strutters to the air forces of the United States, Russia, Belgium, Romania, Japan and Greece. Many of these foreign exported machines fulfilled training roles. By the early 1920s the outdated 1 1/2 Strutters had passed from the scene.",

The JN-4, was a biplane in a tractor configuration, like its predecessors. The <i>Jenny</i> was a two-seater, and could be configured with either wheels, or a float undercarriage. As such, the aircraft could provide for the needs of both the Army Air Corps and the Navy.\n\nThough the <i>Jenny</i> was originally designed as a military trainer, the aircraft type was used successfully in a much broader capacitiy.

In the decade following the Wright brothers' 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, numerous aircraft manufacturing companies sprouted up across Europe. Each built aircraft for sale on the civilian market supporting wealthy sportsmen in their desire to fly. While these early aircraft were not designed for military purposes, military leaders of the pre-World War I era recognized the potential value of \"flying machines\" as reconnaissance platforms. The German aircraft industry was very active in the design and production of civilian machines. Five German firms Albatroswerke, Etrich-Flieger-Werke, Gotha Waggonfabrik, Harlan Verkaufs und Betriebs, and E.Rumpler Luftfahrzeugban all built aircraft which, because of their overall appearance and the configuration of their wings, came to be called \u201c <i>Tauben</i>\u201d (doves). Of these, the Albatros and Rumpler  <i>Tauben</i> were acquired by the German Air Force.\n\nAll  <i>Tauben</i> were large single-winged monoplanes that used wing-warping for lateral control \u2013a system which required a maze of wing-mounted cables and bracing wires. The Rumpler  <i>Taube</i> modeled here first flew in the summer of 1913. It was built from wood framing and doped fabric covering, except for metal sheeting around the engine in the forward fuselage. Configuration of these aircraft varied considerably, even among those built by the same manufacturer, as new innovations, engines and customer desires were incorporated into individual aircraft. As a result the specification information provided below should be considered nominal rather than definitive for all  <i>Tauben</i>. \n\nLike all of its early contemporaries, the Rumpler  <i>Taube</i> was unarmed. Furthermore, its construction, especially its under-carriage, was poorly suited for the rigors of military service on aerodromes -which were converted from farmers' fields- and so breakage was common. Worse, absent proper hangars, the machines sat in the open when not flying. There, the elements took their toll on the  <i>Tauben</i>' wood framing and fabric skins. \n\nRecords show that a total of 60 Rumpler  <i>Tauben</i> were built, a number of which appeared on the rosters of the German Air Force at the beginning of World War I.  <i>Tauben</i> were noted for their stability and some quipped that a pilot could step out of the cockpit and lie down on the wing to nap and the aircraft would continue to fly along safely. However, by late 1915,  <i>Tauben</i> were no longer listed in the German Air Force inventory of aircraft, having likely been replaced by more modern and better performing machines.",

Though officially designated \"T.F.\" for \"Trench Fighter\", the T.F.2 quickly acquired the nickname, \"Salamander\". The Salamander was essentially a modified version of the Sopwith Snipe fighter aircraft. The Salamader looked very similar to its predecessor, and utilized the same powerplant -the Bentley B.R.2 230 hp (172 kW) engine. However, the forward fuselage of the Salamander was an armored box surrounded by steel plates: 0.43 inches (11 mm) on the bottom, 0.31 inches (8 mm) on the front, 0.23 inches (6 mm) on the sides and 0.39 inches (10 mm) behind the cockpit. This armor protected the pilot, engine and fuel tanks from ground fire. Experimental configurations of the Salamander also carried up to eight guns firing down through the floor of the fuselage.\n\nDespite the weight added by the armor, the Salamander's speed was not dramatically reduced. Its maneuverability was, however, adversely affected. Designers felt this was not critical given the new machine's mission. By the War's end, at least 37 Salamanders had been delivered to the Royal Air Force. The concept of aerial ground attack was new and British pilots had no experience in such operations. Air crews were still in training with their new armored Salamanders when the War ended with only a few aircraft having reached France. Production of the Salamander continued until the middle of 1919 with a total of 334 built by Sopwith and 85 by the other manufacturers.

    "history": "Bl\u00e9riot XIs equipped eight squadrons of the Aviation Militaire (French Air Force) at the beginning of World War I in 1914. Constructed entirely of wood and fabric except for a small amount of metal sheeting about the engine in the forward fuselage, the Bl\u00e9riot XI was designed, built and first flown in 1909. The aircraft received world wide acclaim in July of that year when its designer, Louis Bl\u00e9riot, personally flew the machine across the English Channel from France to England -a substantial feat for the time. \n\nSeveral variants of the Bl\u00e9riot XI were built. They were all shoulder-winged monoplanes, with the exception of a parasol-winged variant designed for artillery spotting. The variants differed primarily in their power plants, their internal framing and their crew capacity. Among them were the XI-Ecole Militaire a trainer with a 35 hp engine, the XI-2 Genie (modeled here) a twin-seater with a 70 hp (52 kW) engine and the XI-3 a three-seater with a 100 hp engine. \n\nThe aircraft began service with the French military in 1909. When the British Expeditionary Force was deployed to France in 1914, seven squadrons of Bl\u00e9riot XIs were sent in support. Bl\u00e9riot XIs, built under license by the Italian aircraft firm Societa Italiana Transaerea (S.I.T.), equipped six squadrons of the Italian Air Force when Italy entered World War I. Bl\u00e9riot XIs served primarily as reconnaissance aircraft. However, the first aerial night bombardment of the war was conducted in late 1914 by unit BL 18 who flew Bl\u00e9riot XIs to attack German factories at Metz.\n\nBy the summer of 1915, the Bl\u00e9riot XI was rendered obsolete by the appearance of more modern spotter aircraft with better handling characteristics and downward visibility. Bl\u00e9riot escadrilles were converted to Moraine-Saulnier Type Ls or Caudron G.3s while the aging Bl\u00e9riots were reassigned as trainers.\n\nAn authentic surviving World War I Bl\u00e9riot XI was filmed in the 2006 World War I Hollywood movie <i>Fly Boys</i>, a film centered around the exploits of American aviators flying for the French in the Lafayette Escadrille. Although not airworthy, the Bl\u00e9riot XI was frequently seen in the background during scenes shot in a replicated World War I French aerodrome. In addition to rental fees, a condition for its use was that the producers of the film to take out a huge insurance policy on the rare old aircraft. \n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The vertical stabilizer in this model features a static upright with a movable rudder attached.

    "history": "The Radley-England Waterplane was one of three aircraft originally entered to compete in the 1913 <i>Daily Mail</i> waterplane race around Britain. Built by early aviators, James Radley and Gordon England, the Waterplane faced stiff competition from machines built by Sopwith and the Short Brothers. Unfortunately, the Radley-England team was forced to withdraw before the race due to engine problems.\n\nThe Radley-England design utilized a common overall configuration for seaplanes of its time. The craft was a biplane with two pontoons and a \"pusher\" propeller. The aircraft did, however exhibit a couple of very unique features. Rather than including a standard cockpit or flying-boat hull, the Radley-England's pilot and passengers occupied separate cockpits positioned in the center of each pontoon. The aircraft was first configured with a single cockpit in each pontoon with the pilot and one passenger occupying the right float and up to three passengers in the left. This configuration was later scrapped in favor of two smaller, tandem cockpits in each pontoon.\n\nIn addition to the unusual seating arrangements, the Radley-England Waterplane also utilized a highly unique engine configuration. The aircraft was designed to make use of three 50 hp Gn\u00f4me engines mounted in tandem to drive a single propeller. This unusual configuration was later replaced by a more conventional 150 hp Sunbeam engine.\n\nWhile the Radley-England Waterplane was created at a time when the British Navy was becoming interested in seaplanes for military use, there is no evidence that this plane was mass produced, nor that it ever participated in World War I.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts the Radley-England Waterplane in British naval markings. The source for this paint scheme is unclear. The model also depicts the aircraft equipped with a single Gn\u00f4me engine and small cockpits in each pontoon, each capable of carrying a single person.

    "history": "In 1916, the bomber and army cooperation escadrilles of the Aviation Militaire were flying outdated Farman and Caudron and Voisin aircraft. While design work was progressing on improved replacement for these machines, delivery of production aircraft was not scheduled to begin until the middle of 1917. To better meet the needs of its bombing and army cooperation units, France ordered a number of Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutters from its British allies and began building the aircraft under license.\n\nTwo variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter existed -a two-seat fighter and a single-seat light bomber (modeled here). The bomber version, which the French re-designated the 1.B1, eliminated the rear crew position in order to carry a bomb load within the machine's fuselage. The French-built aircraft included a smaller empennage (tail section) which resulted in improved low-altitude performance. A total of 4,497 of both variants were manufactured by the French, more than three times the number built by the British.  \nThe French continued to employ numbers of the aircraft well into 1918 and sold some of the French-built 1 1/2 Strutters to the air forces of the United States, Russia, Belgium, Romania, Japan and Greece. Many of these foreign exported machines fulfilled training roles. By the early 1920s the outdated 1 1/2 Strutters had passed from the scene.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts an aircraft armed with a forward-firing Lewis gun mounted on the top wing.

    "history": "Built by the German firm AGO Flugzeugwerke, the  AGO C.II, was among a group of flying machines designed and built in immediate response to the out break of World War I. Three variants -the AGO C.I, C.II, and C.III- were built by AGO Flugzeugwerke. All were similar in their external appearance, but the C.II was the most successful and was built in the largest numbers. All  AGO variants had wood framing with a varnished wood veneer covering the central gondola-like fuselage and the two laterally placed tail booms. The wings and tail were fabric covered. The machine was a \"tail dragger\" but had a pair of wheels forward of the fuselage to counter the possibility of a \"nose-over\" when taking off and landing on the rough surfaces of the airfields from which it operated. \n\nThe AGO C.II was one of the few German aircraft types with a \"pusher\" configuration -the engine being at the rear of the machine's fuselage with its propeller pushing the aircraft through the air. German aircraft designers largely regarded this configuration as being inferior to the \"tractor\" type in which the machine's engine and propeller were positioned at the front of the aircraft thus pulling the machine through the air. \n\nThe AGO C.II worked well, and proved to be maneuverable and relatively fast with a good operational range. Its crews, in general, regarded it favorably. Like all of the aircraft deployed during the earliest phases of the War, the C.II served as a reconnaissance platform. But the AGO C.II differed from other aircraft of the time in that it was armed with a machine gun in its forward cockpit manned by its observer. This was unique because, during the early phases of World War I, almost all military reconnaissance machines were unarmed. \n\nAGO C.IIs operated over the Western and Eastern Fronts during the later half of 1915 and most of 1916. By late 1916 they began to be replaced by more modern reconnaissance aircraft.",

    "history": "In 1917, the Austrian arm of the Albatros Company  changed its name to Ph\u00f6nix Flugzeugwerke AG. The firm's senior engineer, Edmund Sparmann, designed the Ph\u00f6nix D.I in an effort to provide the Austro-Hungarian Air Force with an improved fighter. The D.I incorporated several unusual features for a fighter aircraft of the time. These included inward-sloping intra-plane struts on the wings, a 200 hp (149 kW) engine and dual forward-firing machine guns which were completely enclosed in the fuselage. \n\nThe first production machines entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force in February of 1918. Their performance proved adequate but not truly outstanding. Despite a more powerful engine, the aircraft still suffered from a poor power to weight ratio, which contributed to their poor performance characteristics. Nonetheless, the fighter became the favored aircraft for several Austro-Hungarian air aces during 1918. The D.I's production was limited to only 140 machines -120 for the <i>K.u.K. Luftfahrttruppen</i> (the Austrian Air Force) and 20 for the Austrian Navy.\n\nProduction of the Ph\u00f6nix D.I was terminated in mid 1918 in favor of the Ph\u00f6nix D.II and D.IIa. Both aircraft had lighter structures, and substantially improved performance. The The D.IIa was also fitted with a more powerful 230 hp (172 kW) engine. After World War I, Edmund Sparmann developed a series of Ph\u00f6nix fighters for the Swedish Air Force, which would prove even more successful than his World War I Ph\u00f6nix fighters.\n\nThe most colorful Ph\u00f6nix D.Is (like the one modeled here) were those in service with the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Navy variants were deployed from a base at Altura in the defense of the Austro-Hungarian naval bases at Pola and Cattaro, which were frequent targets of Italian bombers.\n <br/><b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> Like many Austro-Hungarian aircraft of World War I, the prototype of this Navy Ph\u00f6nix D.I model had red and white wing and tail stripes, replicating the colors of the monarchy's coat of arms, a copy of which is displayed on the rudder of the aircraft.",

Marix of the Royal Naval Air Service, destroyed the German airship Zeppelin Z.IX and its storage shed at Dusseldorf while flying a Sopwith Tabloid. This event marked the first significant bombing attack by a British aviator. Marix dropped two small incendiary bombs causing the airship's hydrogen filled gas cells to ignite turning the Zeppelin into an inferno. \n\nThe Tabloid began as a racing and demonstration aircraft in 1913, well before World War I. During its official trials at Farnborough, the aircraft returned performance figures that surpassed aircraft of the time. After a seaplane version blew away the competition at the Schneider Trophy race in April of 1914, the British military took interest. Both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service placed orders for the aircraft. \n\nTabloids saw extensive service over the Western Front during the early weeks of the War. During this early period military aircraft were usually unarmed with pilots employing their personal pistols and rifles in aerial combat. In the very early spring of 1915 machine guns were fitted to Tabloids in some squadrons. They served with distinction on the Western Front but were also used in the Mediterranean and Middle East theaters of operation. Production of Tabloids ended in the spring of 1915 as they were phased out and replaced by more capable machines. However, a numbers of Tabloids remained deployed on the home front as Zeppelin interceptors and as trainers while others were employed as reconnaissance aircraft on the Western Front and in the Middle East.

French aviation company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des \u00c9tablissements Nieuport, hoped to sell the new machine to wealthy sportsmen, smitten by the flying craze which swept Europe after the Wright brothers successful flight. First flown in late 1910, the VI was a shoulder-winged monoplane which employed wing-warping for lateral control. This arrangement required extensive wire cables on the upper and lower surfaces of its wing. It had a relatively clean, aerodynamic contour for its time and was constructed of wood framing with a fabric covering -except for sheet metal about the engine and forward fuselage. \n\nOn June 21, 1911, Nieuport sponsored a promotional air show in an effort to boost weak sales of the aircraft. During the show, the VI set a new world speed record of 83 mph (134 km/h). Sales of the VI soared and the aircraft became very popular on the civilian scene. The Nieuport's record-setting flight also drew the attention of the French military. Leaders recognized the potential value of a fast aircraft, which could fly over enemy territory and report on positions and troop movements. With this in mind, the Aviation Militaire purchased a number VI aircraft. No significant modifications were required for their military service and all of the VIs were placed into a single reconnaissance escadrille. When World War I broke out in August of 1914 the escadrille was immediately placed into operation on the Western Front. \n\nThe VIs were as successful in their military role as they had been when flown for sport. However, they had very brief careers. By the autumn of 1915 new German fighter aircraft, which were faster than the VIs, appeared over the Western Front. Worse, the new fighters were equipped with synchronized machine guns. The unarmed VIs were totally outclassed and by late 1915 had all been withdrawn from French service. The VI kept flying somewhat longer with two of France's allies -Italy and Russia. Both countries continued to deploy the aircraft until early 1916 when they too retired their VIs.",

A fighter intended for operations on the Italian Front, the Aviatik fighter was developed to replace the unpopular Hansa-Brandenberg D.I, which had earned the ominous nickname, \"The Flying Coffin\". \n\nThe new Aviatik D.I utilized conventional construction techniques for the time -wood framing with a thin plywood veneer covering of its fuselage and doped fabric covering of its wings and tail surfaces. However, Berg also incorporated some unusual design features into the aircraft. When it became apparent early on that two side-mounted radiators were insufficient to cool the D.I's engine, Berg shifted to a large car-type unit built in the nose. The pilot also sat relatively high in the cockpit, placing his eye-line just below the upper wing, affording him good all-around visibility.\n\nInitial trials of an unarmed Aviatik D.I prototype were conducted on January 24, 1917 and showed the machine to have considerable promise. It was ordered into production by the Austro-Hungarian High Command with the first armed production aircraft entering service with Fliks (squadrons of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force) during the spring.

The first B.E.2c flew in the months immediately before the outbreak of World War I. When England entered the conflict, large orders for B.E. 2s were placed by both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service for use as reconnaissance aircraft. The numbers ordered were so enormous that production, under license, was spread among a number of British aviation companies- Bristol, Vickers, Ruston Proctor, Armstrong Whitworth and Wolseley. \n\nThe B.E.2c was a two-seat biplane of standard wood and fabric construction. The B.E.2c had some success as a reconnaissance and bombing platform. However, the appearance of the Fokker monoplane, which was equipped with a propeller-synchronized machine gun, exploited the B.E.2's weak-points -its lack of armament and poor maneuverability. As air-to-air combat became more common, many attempts were made -mostly by the pilots- to mount machine guns on the B.E.2c. One method (modeled here) involved mounting a rear-firing Lewis gun between the cockpits. This arrangement proved particularly impractical as the observer/gunner seated in the front cockpit had to fire directly over the head of the pilot.\n\nLosses of the aircraft became severe enough that the machines were largely withdrawn from solo reconnaissance duties and were deployed in force as bombers usually with a fighter escort. Others were deployed in Homeland Zeppelin interdiction with at least three Zeppelins having been destroyed by B.E. 2s. By late 1917 B.E. 2s had been largely replaced in all combat roles by more modern aircraft. A few labored on as trainers until the end of the War.

    "history": "In the early summer of 1917 the <i>Idflieg</i> (German Inspectorate of Flying Troops) issued a specification to the German aircraft industry for a new \"CL\" class of aircraft which could serve as escorts for the larger C-class reconnaissance planes. The Hannover based firm Hannoversche Waggonfabrik AG responded with a new machine designated the Hannover CL.II. Two further variants of the aircraft soon followed and differed only in their engines and wingtip design. These were the CL.III and the CL.IIIa (modeled here). \n\nThe CL.IIIa was a compact, two-seat biplane. It featured a plywood-covered fuselage that was highly resistant to battle damage. The aircraft's wings and tail structures had wood framing with a doped fabric covering. The Hannover aircraft also included an unusual biplane tail. This configuration was adopted to reduce the span required when only a single tail plane was employed. The tail design reduced blind spots and gave the observer/gunner a broader field of fire. The crew's visibility was also aided by the position of the top wing, which was almost level with the top of the fuselage.\n\nPrototype flight trials were completed in November of 1917. While the new machine had average speed, its robustness, handling, and rate of climb were outstanding. The new model was given rave reviews by its test pilots and manufacture of the aircraft was immediately ordered by the Idflieg. \n\nProduction aircraft equipped schutzstaffeln (protection squadrons) of the German Air Force by January of 1918. Allied pilots often mistook the two-seat escorts for single-seat fighters, not realizing their mistake until the rear gunner fired off a stream of bullets from his Parabellum machinegun. The CL.IIIa proved to be a formidable opponent even after the allies knew what they were dealing with. The aircraft's plywood skin made it bullet resistant and very difficult to shoot down.\n\nAlthough they arrived quite late on the scene, 537 CL.IIIa's were placed into service with the German Air Force during the final ten months of the War. During that interval they were among the most numerous reconnaissance and escort aircraft deployed by the Germans on the Western Front, the only theater over which the Hannover CL.IIIa operated.",

    "history": "The N-9 seaplane, which began development in late 1916, was essentially a float-equipped variant of the JN-4 Jenny training aircraft. The N-9 was a quite large machine for a training aircraft of the World War I era. Built of wood framing, it had a plywood veneer over its fuselage with doped fabric covering of its wings and tail surfaces. A thin metal alloy surrounded the engine. Its central pontoon and bilateral wing floats were also of metal construction. Aside from the floatplane undercarriage, The N-9 differed from its landplane equivalent primarily in its wingspan and the shape of its airfoil -the wing having been extended to generate the extra lift necessary to compensate for the weight of the float.\n\nFour hundred-fifty N-9s were produced during World War I. Entering service at United States Navy flight schools in April, 1917 they served as the standard seaplane trainer. In its initial configuration, the N-9 proved adequate for basic training. However, in order to meet the power needs for advanced gunnery and bomber training, later models were outfitted with a more powerful Hispano-Suiza engine. After World War I, the N-9 remained the Navy's principle seaplane and flying boat training aircraft for the next decade. 560 aircraft were produced before the type was retired.",

    "history": "The Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutter was the first British aircraft to have a machine gun synchronized to fire forward through its propeller arc. Designed and built by the Sopwith Aviation Company, it acquired the name of \"1 1/2 Strutter\" from its characteristic W shaped cabane wing struts. Though the name was originally unofficial, the Royal Navy Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps later adopted the name after it entered common usage. \n\nTwo variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter existed -a two-seat fighter and a single-seat light bomber (modeled here). The bomber version eliminated the rear crew position in order to carry a bomb load within the machine's fuselage. The single-seat variant was used primarily by the Royal Naval Air Service, though some were delivered to the Royal Flying Corps.\n\nA total of 1,513 of both variants of the 1 1/2 Strutter were built in Great Britain during World War I. British demand for the machines eventually exceeded the ability of its parent company to supply the needed aircraft. Other companies began to manufacture it under license, including the British firms Fairey; Morgan & Co.; Hooper; Westland; Vickers; Mann & Egerton; and Ruston & Proctor. Several French aviation companies also built both the two seat fighter and the single seat bomber version under license. A total of 4,497 of both variants were manufactured by the French, more than three times the number built by the British. \n\nIn the spring of 1916, British units in the Royal Navy Air Service began flying the 1 1/2 Strutter. Later the Royal Flying Corps also ordered the machine to use on the Western Front. However, By the close of 1916, the 1 1/2 Strutter was becoming obsolete and by the middle of 1917 most of the British machines were being withdrawn from frontline combat service. \n\nThe French continued to employ numbers of the aircraft well into 1918 and sold some of the French-built 1 1/2 Strutters to the air forces of the United States, Russia, Belgium, Romania, Japan and Greece. Many of these foreign exported machines fulfilled training roles. By the early 1920s the outdated 1 1/2 Strutters had passed from the scene. <b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts an aircraft armed with a forward-firing Lewis gun mounted on the top wing.

    "history": "Germany's first mass-produced military aircraft were called <i>Tauben</i> (Doves) -so named because of the bird-like shape of their wings. Austrian designer, Igo Etrich developed the first prototype <i>Taube</i>, before licensing the design the Rumpler aircraft. Variants of Etrich's design were soon being produced by at least 54 German and Austrian aircraft firms, including Harlan-Flugzeugwerke (modeled here), which produced at least four known variants. \nThis aircraft was in that group of \"flying machines\" which were a part of the German Air Force when World War I erupted in August of 1914. Most <i>Tauben</i> featured a single aileron and unique split rudder configuration. Most variants, including this Harlan model were two-seat monoplanes. The <i>Taube</i> modeled here was likely an early variant from 1911. The aircraft includes a long bracing girder beneath the wing, which was absent in later Harlan designs. \nThe Harlan <i>Taube</i> flew unarmed except for sidearms carried by pilots and served primarily in a reconnaissance role. The German Air Force acquired several of these machines in 1913 and they were available at the outbreak of World War I. The precise number of Harlan <i>Taube</i> aircraft deployed by Germany is unknown -probably very few because the initial 1913 acquisition was never augmented. It is known that during the first days of War, Germany flew <i>Tauben</i> during reconnaissance sorties in support of advancing German ground troops. \nThe aircraft proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of combat service and their careers were very short lived. Their frail wood and fabric construction could not hold up to the rough fields and cow pastures from which they operated. Undercarriage damage and mechanical failures were common. By early 1915 the Harlan <i>Taube</i> had disappeared having been replaced by far better, more modern and more robust reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> Most Harlan <i>Tauben</i> displayed the manufacturer's name in large letters on the fuselage.

    "history": "The Handley Page O/400 and its predecessor, the O/100 were the principle British heavy bombers of World War I. British interest in acquiring a large bomber capable of carrying a heavy bomb load over long distances began in 1914 before the outbreak of World War I. The Royal Navy wished to monitor the movements of German U-boats and warships, which could interfere with the shipping lanes through which the greater part of England's food and raw materials were delivered. The aircraft firm, Handley Page Ltd. responded with a twin-engine machine designated the O/100, which proved successful as both a naval patrol aircraft and a land bomber.\n\nHandley Page continued to improve the design of the O/100 and, in 1917, installed a new fuel system. The new system moved the aircraft's fuel tanks out of the engine nacelles, placing them instead in the fuselage and upper wing. This new version was re-designated the Handley-Page O/400 (modeled here). Like the 100, the 400 had wings that folded back against its fuselage, allowing storage in existing hangers. Other improvements and changes were structural in nature and were largely confined to the interior of the aircraft. The biggest difference between the two bombers lay in the more powerful engines of the 400. \n\nThe O/400 first saw combat service in the spring of 1917. It flew U-Boat patrols and bombed German military depots and industrial targets. Over 400 Handley Page O/400 bombers entered service with the British Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Flying Service before the Armistice but only one British O/400 was ever based outside England or France. A single machine was sent to Palestine in July of 1918 to support the campaigns of Colonel T. E. Lawrence -better known as \"Lawrence of Arabia\". \n\nThe American firm, Standard Aircraft Corporation, was also contracted to build 1,000 Handley-Page O/400s for the United States Army Air Corps. Instead of British Rolls-Royce power plants, the American O/400s were fitted with American Liberty engines. The day before their production began, WWI ended. As a result, the majority of the order was cancelled and only 107 aircraft were completed. The vast majority went straight into storage to be scrapped years later. However, seven were refurbished in 1920 and used in General Billy Mitchell's bombing trials on former German World War I warships anchored in the Chesapeake Bay -trials intended to prove the value of air power in naval warfare.",

    "history": "Though Russia had the largest air force among the belligerent nations at the start of World War I, it also had the least developed aircraft industry, having relied primarily on imported designs to build its forces. With the onset of war, the country continued to import foreign aircraft and focused on building proven British and French airframes under license.\n\nThe Russian aircraft manufacturer, Aktzionernoe Obshchestvo Vozdukhoplavania V.A. Lebedeva (V.A. Lebedev Joint-Stock Aeronautics Company), which was founded by Vladimir A. Lebedev was just one of the firms producing foreign designs for the Russian Air Force. The Lebed VII modeled here was one such design and was based on the Sopwith Tabloid aircraft.\n\nLebedev modified Sopwith's original design for the Lebed VII. Realizing that his aircraft would be flying from rough and poorly maintained landing fields, he increased the strength of its internal framing and fitted their undercarriage with anti-nose over struts. The aircraft was otherwise very similar to its British counterpart. Like the Tabloid, the Lebed VII featured biplane wings of equal span and chord; it employed wing-warping for lateral control, and included the same distinctive engine cowling. The exact number of Lebed VII aircraft produced is unclear, though the manufacturer ordered and received sixteen tachometers from the Sopwith Company, which suggests that the production run was quite limited. \n\nThe aircraft flew unarmed and was deployed strictly for reconnaissance and training purposes. A few may have been fitted with a machine gun thus theoretically making them reconnaissance fighters, but no official documents or photographic evidence has been found to support this claim. Records indicate that several Lebed VII aircraft crashed during takeoff and landing resulting in non-combat losses. The aircraft served with the Imprial Russian Air Force from 1914 until early 1916 and were removed from service by the time of the 1917 Russian Revolution.",

The Farmans, which had been the main reconnaissance platforms for the French since the outbreak of World War I, were unable to defend themselves from the German and Austro-Hungarian fighters that had begun patrolling the skies over the Front. \n\nAfter being turned down by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Henri et Maurice Farman, which was first offered the contract for the new aircraft, STA\u00e9 turned to aircraft engineer, G. L\u00e9pere. The aircraft L\u00e9pere created was a tractor biplane, which received the designation A.R.1.\n\nThe A.R.1 utilized conventional construction for the time -a biplane of mixed wood and steel framing, doped fabric covering and metal about the engine and forward fuselage. The aircraft's wings, however, were laid out in a unique negative-stagger configuration. The upper wing was placed slightly aft of the lower wing. Furthermore, the lower wing was not fixed to the fuselage but was, rather, suspended below on four heavy, wooden intra-wing struts. A later variant, re-designated the A.R.2 (modeled here) featured a more powerful engine and a slightly smaller wing surface.\n\nFlight trials of the new Dorand A.R.s were completed in September of 1916 and the first production models arrived at the Western Front the following February. The new aircraft performed marginally better than the old Farmans, though not as much as initially hoped. As such, French air crews, while grateful to be rid of their old Farmans, never gave the newer Dorands anything more than grudging approval. \n\nBoth the A.R.1 and A.R.2 flew side by side and were widely used throughout 1917. At one point they equipped 18 observation units flying over the Western and Italian Fronts. However, by 1918, the A.R.s began to be replaced by more advanced SPADs and Salmsons. After the War the A.R.1 and 2 were deemed redundant. Aside from a few which were sold to other countries and several which were sold on the civilian market, they were scrapped.",

Some evidence suggests that the R.11 may have originally been intended as a multi-purpose reconnaissance, light bombing and escort platform, but operational units used the aircraft exclusively as an escort fighter.\n\nThe R.11 was of standard wood and fabric construction except for its engine housings and the forward and dorsal aspects of its fuselage, which were covered with aluminum sheeting. A biplane, the R.11's two engines were completely enclosed in unusual triangular housings mounted between its wings. The R.11 had three crew cockpits. The pilot flew the plane from the center position below the wing, while the two gunners occupied the fore and aft positions. The R.11's twin gun emplacements allowed the aircraft to bring considerable firepower to bear on attacking fighters without having to take evasive maneuvers.\n\nThe aircraft first entered service in early 1918, though production delays slowed delivery of the aircraft. R.11s were often assigned to specific groupes de bombardement (bomber groups) to provide escort services. It is unclear how successful the aircraft were against German fighters, but the at the time of the Armistice six escadrilles were each equipped with 15 Caudron Type R.11 aircraft.

Although over 2,000 B.E.2cs had been built they, suffered from poor handling characteristics and armament, which made them an easy target for enemy fighters. The new R.E.8 included a more powerful engine and much improved armament. The R.E.8 also reversed the cockpit positions -placing the pilot in the forward cockpit- this allowed the observer to act as a gunner as well. The B.E.2 had these positions reversed, which proved impractical once the necessity of defensive armament became apparent. Interestingly, however, the R.E.8 retained the inherently stable characteristics of its predecessor, which made evasive maneuvering more difficult.\n\nLike its predecessor, the R.E.8's engine had a rather unique method of cooling. Its inline piston engine was air cooled instead of having a liquid cooling system with an external radiator which was common on most inline aircraft engines of the time. A large air scoop on top of the engine compartment channeled air across the cylinders. \n\nProduction of the R.E.8 began in August of 1916 and the aircraft began equipping the Royal Flying Corps the following month. No fewer than 16 reconnaissance units eventually employed the machines. In addition to serving on the Western Front, the R.E.8 was used by two British squadrons based in Italy, two in Mesopotamia, two in Palestine and three home defense squadrons. Following its introduction into service, the R.A.F. R.E.8 quickly acquired the rhyming nickname \"Harry Tate\" after the British comedian. \n\nDespite its improved armament, the R.E.8 proved to be vulnerable to German fighters which necessitated its withdrawal from reconnaissance duties over enemy territory unless accompanied by a fighter escort. As the War progressed, many R.E.8s were diverted to ground attack and bombing operations. Others became trainers. Although some R.E.8s remained in service until the end of the War in various roles, by the last year of the War they had been largely replaced by superior Sopwith 11/2 Strutter aircraft.",

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the German High Command ordered numbers of Fokker's new aircraft for the German Air Force and designated them Fokker E.Is. The Fokker E.I was followed by new E.II, E.III and E.IV variants. The E.III (modeled here) was produced in the largest numbers. While all the Fokker monoplanes retained a similar appearance, the E.III had a more powerful engine than its predecessors.\n\nThe Fokker E-series possessed a new and revolutionary device -a propeller synchronized machine gun. Rods connected the aircraft's rotary engine to the gun, which allowed it to fire without risk of hitting the propeller. Fokker called his new device \"Stangensteuerung\" - or \"push-rod control.\" The accuracy afforded by this device gave the Central Powers an advantage in air power on the Western Front. Though only about 300 of the Fokker <i>Eindeckers</i> were built, they proved so effective that the Allies came to call these aircraft \"the <i>Eindecker</i> Scourge.\" \n\nDespite their successful introduction, the service careers of the Fokker monoplanes were brief -extending from July 1915 to early 1916. By 1916, the Allies had introduced new, better performing machines that could compete with the <i>Eindeckers</i>. The E-series was soon retired from frontline fighter units, though a few lingered on briefly as trainers. By 1917 they had disappeared.",

The D.IIIa added modified wing tips and a new and more powerful engine to the original D.III model. The D.IIIa also somewhat resembled the earlier German L.F.G. Roland D.I and D.II fighters. \n\nThe D.IIIa's structure allowed for an aerodynamic, efficient, and sturdy aircraft. The craft's wooden fuselage frame was covered by a thin wood veneer, allowing for a smooth, varnished finish. The machine's wings and tail also incorporated wood framing. These components, however, were covered with a doped fabric - a common construction technique of the time. \n\nThe Pfalz D.III served as one of the main German fighters from late 1917 until summer 1918. The D.IIIa did not enter service until 1918. The D.IIIa reached its peak deployment on the Western Front in April 1918. At that time, German fighter units employed 433 of these machines. These aircraft, however, were gradually phased out in favor of the vastly superior Fokker D.VII. About 600 D.IIIs were manufactured during World War I, and about 350 remained in service in August 1918.\n\nThe aircraft modeled here was flown on the Western Front during the last months of World War I by Carl von Degelow, a member of the Jadgstaffel (squadron) 40, Germany Air Force.",

    "title": "Halberstadt CL.II",
    "history": "The Halberstadt CL.II was unique among its World War I contemporaries. In late 1916 the Idflieg (the German Air Force General Staff) conceived a machine which could function as a reconnaissance platform (a C-type), an infantry support aircraft (a J-type) and at the same time have sufficient attributes to be completive as a fighter (a D-type). Such an amalgamation of features was an ambitious order for aeronautical designers of the time. But German firm, Halberst\u00e4dter Flugzeug-Werke GmbH, created an aircraft that exceeded expectations. \n\nThe CL.II was constructed of wood framing with a thin plywood veneer covering its fuselage. Plywood also covered the center section of the upper wing which contained a flush-fit radiator for the machine's liquid-cooled engine. All of its other surface areas were covered with a doped fabric. The CL.II had a powerful engine and aerodynamically smooth appearance. The plane had only two sets of thin metal intra-wing struts and a minimum of bracing wires. This greatly reduced wind resistance and gave the CL.II outstanding performance. \n\nAfter wildly successful flight trials on May 17, 1917 the CL.II was ordered into production. It entered service on the Western Front in August of 1917 where it achieved immediate acclaim due to its excellent maneuverability, speed and climb rate. These features combined with the wide field of fire provided by the configuration of the machine's design, allowed the rear gunner to effectively engage enemy single seat fighters on equal terms. The CL.II also became the mainstay of the <i>Schlachtstaffeln</i> (close air-support squadrons). Seven-hundred CL.IIs were built by Halberstadt and demand for the aircraft became so great that a further 200 were produced, under license, by the German firm Bayerisvhe Flugzeugwerke (BFW). The machines remained in active front line service until the War's end. \n\nThe colorful Halberstadt CL II modeled here was unit #14277/17 which on June 4, 1918 crashed on takeoff at its aerodrome in Bissenghem, Germany, seriously injuring its pilot, Paul Schwarze, and killing its gunner, Franz Schumm. Although not airworthy, a single World War I era CL II survives today on display at the Polish Aviation Museum in Cracow, Poland.",

The G.4 was a maze of bracing wires with twin tail booms and an armed gunner-observer compartment forward of the cockpit. The aircraft's two engines were housed in streamlined nacelles suspended between its upper and lower wings. Caudron developed several variants of the G.4 for different missions -the A2 for reconnaissance, the B2 for bombing (modeled here) and the E2 for training.\n\nCaudron built a total of 1,358 G.4s during the course of World War I, which began operational service during the summer of 1915. Bl\u00e9riot, S.P.A.D. and Italian manufacturer A.E.R. also built the G.4 under license. The Italians found that the G.4's strong rate of climb and high ceiling made it well suited to operations over the Alps. The British Royal Naval Air Service also acquired several G.4s and assigned them to raids against German seaplane and Zeppelin bases in Belgium. However, the aircraft's inability to defend against attacks from behind soon led the Aviation Militaire to order a better armed reconnaissance aircraft. Some of the bombers remained in Italian service in the later months of the war but by 1918 they disappeared from the Western Front. None were operational outside Europe.",

    "history": "The Borel Aeroyacht was one of several flying boats designed by French aviation pioneer, Francis Denhaut. He developed the Aeroyacht in 1912 for the French firm, Etablissements Borel, which entered the aircraft in the 1913 Paris-Deauville competition. The competition consisted of a race along the river, Seine from Paris to the city of Deauville on the English Channel followed by sea trials. It was set up to select two seaplane designs to enter production for the French Navy.\n\nThe Aeroyacht, one of two Borel aircraft entered in the competition, featured a wood-framed hull covered with a varnished wood veneer. The aircraft's two crewmen sat side-by-side in its open cockpit. The sesquiplane wings and tail surfaces were framed in wood and had a doped fabric covering. Two outrigger stabilizing pontoons were mounted beneath each lower wing tip. A single 100 h.p. engine was mounted high on a steel framework behind the upper wing in a position intended to help avoid sea spray during takeoff and landing. Publications from the time indicate that the Aeroyacht was considered quite advanced and expectations were high.\n\nUnfortunately, the Aeroyacht's performance at the Paris-Deauville trials did not live up to expectations. The aircraft failed to finish the race and was subsequently disqualified from the sea-trials portion of the event. In the aftermath of the Aeroyacht's poor performance, Denhaut was fired from Borel. Two years later, however, he formed his own company, Donnet-Denhaut in partnership with Jerome Donnet. This endeavour proved more successful and the new firm went on to produce a series of seaplanes for the French Navy.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts an Aeroyacht as it might have looked in service with the French Navy. The model's configuration most closely resembles plan drawings of the Borel Aeroyacht Type Denhaut I, which appeared in 1913 issues of the aviation journals, <i>Flugsport</i> and <i>Aero and Hydro</i>. Photos of the Aeroyacht taken at the Paris-Deauville competition suggest the design had been further modified by the time of the race.

In January of 1916 Geoffery de Havilland, chief aeronautical engineer of Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (Airco), responded to an official request by British military leaders for such an aircraft and the D.H.4 was the result. Geoffery de Havilland's new machine made its maiden flight in August of 1916 under the control of the designer himself. The powerplant originally specified for the D.H.4 was a 160 hp Beardmore water cooled engine. By the time the D.H.4 design was being prepared, however, this engine had been replaced by a larger, 230 hp version. The first production D.H.4s received this upgraded engine, or a 250 hp Rolls Royce V12, called the \"Eagle\". The D.H.4s, with their new power plants, fulfilled all performance expectations and in aviation circles the machines quickly acquired the name of its designer. \n\nThe first production D.H.4s were delivered to No. 55 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps deployed on the Western Front in March of 1917. They immediately gained popularity among their crews and came to be judged the best single-engine bombers then in service. Even with a full bomb load they retained excellent speed and handling qualities. After release of their bombs they could compete on equal terms with enemy fighters. The success of the D.H.4 created a demand that exceed the resources of Airco, and several other British aircraft firms began building the machine under license. Many were also built under license in the United States. The American models were fitted with the American 400 hp (298 kW) Liberty engine leading to their nickname \"Liberty Planes\".They served with the British Royal Flying Corps, the British Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Canadian Air Service, the United States Army Air Force and the air services of South Africa and New Zealand. The ubiquitous D.H.4s were widely deployed in a multitude of roles on the Western Front and in other far-flung theaters of operation during the last two years of the War. \n\nFollowing World War I the machines were employed by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians during the Russian Civil War of 1919. Post-war, more than 400 D.H.4s were modified for civilian service and used as transports and mail planes. In these roles they remained flying until 1932. The Airco D.H.4 was, without question, one of the finest and most successful aircraft of the era.",

Roe & Company Ltd (Avro). At least three production aircraft were purchased by the Royal Naval Air Service, and were active when World War I began in August of 1914. \n\nThe 503 was a two-seat biplane of standard wood and fabric construction. The seaplane undercarriage consisted of two pontoons covered with rubber-proofed cloth and sprung with rubber cord. The tail float attached directly to the bottom of the rudder and would move as the pilot steered. The 503 was able to be quickly dismantled for shipping -a common consideration in Avro designs.\n\nInterestingly, the prototype for the Avro 503 was sold to Germany prior to the start of World War I. The aircraft became the basis for the German, Gotha WD.I seaplane, which appeared in early 1914 and spawned a line of subsequent German seaplanes.

The M.9 was intended to provide the Italian Naval Air Service with a new long-ranged armed reconnaissance bomber which could patrol the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas keeping track of, and attacking, the naval assets of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires.\n\nDesign of the new flying boat began in early 1918 and borrowed much from previous Macchi aircraft, particularly its immediate predecessor, the M.8. The hull-shaped fuselage was formed from wood framing covered by a plywood veneer. The area above the waterline was finished with a high gloss varnish, the area below the waterline with anti-fouling paint. The aircraft's wings and tail surfaces had wood framing with doped fabric covering and outrigger stabilizing floats positioned beneath the wingtips. The machine's single engine was enclosed in a metal housing mounted above the fuselage on a steel framework. Its enclosure and elevated position were intended to protect it from sea spray during takeoff and landing. \n\nUnfortunately for the Allies, Macchi M.9 aircraft did not begin equipping Italian naval squadrons until the autumn of 1918, only a few weeks before the end of hostilities. As a result, they saw very limited action and their contribution to the war effort was minimal. Military production of the M.9 was terminated with the end of the War, by which time only 30 had been completed and delivered. However, Macchi converted the aircraft type for civil transport with the M.9 bis variant.

Its mission, in case of war, was to patrol the North Sea and follow the movements of the British Home Fleet based at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. \n\nThe AGO Seaplane is historic. It was probably the first aircraft to ever be constructed with amphibious capabilities. Positioned beneath each of its two pontoons were a pair of wheels and beneath its two tail pontoons were tail skids. These features allowed the AGO seaplane to take off and land from either land or sea. The aircraft was able to taxi into and out of the water on a concrete ramp. This ability proved advantageous by allowed the machine to quickly escape the corrosive effects of sea water when it was not flying. \n\nA large aircraft, the AGO Seaplane had typical construction for the time. Fabric covered the wood- frame of the aircraft's wings and tail surfaces while its fuselage and pontoons were covered with wood veneer. Two large petrol tanks were suspended beneath the upper wing endowing it with substantial operational endurance. \n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August of 1914, AGO Seaplanes of II.SFA patrolled the North Sea from their base at Wilhelmshaven. The patrols provided the German fleet -also based at Wilhelmshaven- intelligence on the movements of the British Navy, which was then the most powerful naval force in the world. Records indicate that during the opening weeks of the War, AGO Seaplanes played a role in following British ships involved in the naval blockade of Germany. \n\nThe operational effectiveness of the AGO Seaplanes is unclear.

One of the earliest production variants of is modeled here. \n\nProduction aircraft entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force in early 1916. During the entire production run of the aircraft, which extended to the end of the War, no less than eighteen different variations of the machine were built. Externally all the variants appeared identical differing only in minor structural details and their increasingly more powerful engines. Framing of all the variants was of wood with a varnished wood veneer covering the fuselage and an aluminum casement around the engine. Intra-wing struts were metal, not wood, and were cantered inward - both were uncommon features for aircraft of the era. \n\nThe machines were widely deployed in reconnaissance, observation, artillery-spotting and light bombing duties along all sectors of the Western, Italian and Russian fronts. They were highly regarded and became the favorites of their crews due to their excellent handling, agility, durability and dependability. The installation of ever more powerful engines continually improved the performance of the successive variants - a factor which engendered even greater crew approval. The Brandenburg C.I continued in constant service and became the \"reconnaissance work horse\" of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force until the War's conclusion in November of 1918.",

Rather, it was designed and built as an advanced trainer for fighter pilots. \n\nMost Nieuport 21 aircraft were employed by the French Aviation Militaire in its flight schools, however a few were assigned to front line units alongside Nieuport 17s. Beginning in early 1917 the French supplied substantial numbers of Nieuport 21s to the Imperial Russian Air Force, which used the aircraft as front-line fighters. Sixty-eight additional machines were built under license by the Russian firm, Dux, in St. Petersburg. The Nieuport 21 was the most numerous Nieuport aircraft serving with the Imperial Russian Air Force. The machine was very popular with Russian pilots despite its relatively small power plant, due to its excellent maneuverability and reliability. In addition to their French and Russian service, one hundred ninety-seven Nieuport 21 aircraft were purchased by the United States Army Air Force for use as trainers, while five aircraft were briefly deployed by the British Royal Naval Air Service. \n\nThe prototype of this model was an active fighter with the Imperial Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front during the weeks immediately prior to the Russian Communist Revolution, an event which forced Russia's withdrawal from World War I. Following the Russian revolution, the machines remained a part of the Red Air Force and were not retired until 1926.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model replicates the insignia and markings employed by the Imperial Russian Air Force during its involvement in World War I.",

    "history": "The Voisin 10 LAR was a successful night-bomber developed by French aeronautical engineer, Gabriel Voisin. Like the series of Voisin aircraft that preceded it, the Voisin 10 utilized a unique four-wheeled landing gear configuration. Two forward wheels were mounted on a delicate frame protruding in front of the fuselage nose, while the aircraft's two main wheels were positioned beneath the rear of the fuselage gondola. With this configuration, the aircraft remained horizontal while on the ground or during take-off and landing. This gave pilots greater visibility compared to a \"tail dragging\" aircraft.\n\nThe Voisin night bombers included a number of features designed to aid them in their mission. They were typically painted in an overall dark, flat gray or black for nighttime camouflage. To make night-flying easier, the Voisin 10 LARs also included nose-mounted landing lights, red and green wing tip recognition lights and an illuminated pilot instrument panel. Such lighting was unusual for World War I aircraft since most flying took place during daylight hours. Equally unusual for a World War I military aircraft were the two large torpedo-shaped petrol tanks suspended beneath the upper wing on either side of the fuselage. The machine's bomb load was carried beneath the lower wings.\n\nVoisin-equipped escadrilles provided air support by attacking enemy troop formations and industrial targets during several battles, including Picardie, Flanders, Aisne, Santerre and Saint Mihiel. After the War, however, the Voisin 10 was soon replaced by more advanced aircraft.",

    "history": "The Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI represents the largest fixed-wing aircraft of World War I. It could carry two 2,200 lb bombs; no other bomber had been capable of carrying even one before that time. Its wingspan measured over 138 feet. It weighed over 12 and a half tons when empty, requiring 12 or, on some machines, 16 wheels to support this weight. Each of its four engines powered an enormous 14 foot 5 inch propeller.\n\nThe Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI was designed to bomb major Allied cities, especially London. The bomber was huge, relatively slow and not very maneuverable. To make its missions more effective, the R.VI operated at night when it would be less vulnerable to Allied attack. Its paint scheme consisted of an overall dark mottled blue or a dark lozenge pattern, designed to camouflage the machine during night operations. Even the German black iron-cross insignias were applied without their usual white backgrounds to enhance the machine's stealth. \n\nWith their large size, the Zeppelin-Staakens were time-consuming and costly to manufacture. Only 18 were built in all. Of those 18, the last two of the series added a fifth engine to the original design. Mounted in the fuselage behind the enclosed crew cabin, the fifth engine powered superchargers for the aircraft's four propeller-driving engines. This new revolutionary advance allowed these two Zeppelin-Staakens to reach a height of almost 20,000 feet even when carrying a full bomb load. Since Allied fighters and anti-aircraft ground fire could not function efficiently at such altitudes, the five-engined R.VIs were almost immune to Allied defenses. This model represents one of these five-engine versions.\n\nDespite their few numbers, these bombers caused considerable damage. During the final months of World War I, Zeppelin-Staaken R.VIs flew 52 raids over London dropping 2,772 bombs weighing a total of 196 tons. On the night of February 16, 1918, a Zeppelin-Staaken dropped the first 2,200 lb bombs ever deployed in warfare. One hit the Royal Hospital in Chelsea, killing or injuring much of the medical staff and many of the institution's patients, the majority of whom were wounded soldiers from the Western Front. To date, the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI remains the largest bomber ever to have attacked England.",

    "history": "The Fairey Campania, built by the British aviation firm Fairey, was the first aircraft to be specifically designed for service on an aircraft carrier. The British Royal Navy was the first to undertake the development of aircraft carriers. One of the earliest of these ships was <i>HMS Campania</i>, a converted Cunard transatlantic passenger liner for which Fairey's aircraft was named. \n\nThe new aircraft was a large, single-engine floatplane. Due to shortages of the Rolls Royce Eagle V engine, the first production models were instead equipped with a Sunbeam Maori II powerplant. However, some Campanias, like the one modeled here, would eventually be upgraded to the Rolls Royce Eagle VIII, the most powerful aircraft engine built in Great Britain during the War. The 345 hp (257 kW) engine turned a monster propeller over 12 feet (3.81 m) in diameter. \n\nThe aircraft was intended to launch from the carrier's deck, riding on a wheeled trolley. Upon returning to the carrier, the Campania would land on the water to be hoisted aboard by crane. A steel ring mounted in the center of the upper wing served as an attachment point for the aircraft's retrieval.\n\nOnly 62 Campania aircraft were built before their production was terminated with the end of the War. They operated from the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers, from shore facilities along England's coastline and from the Royal Naval Base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. A late arrival minimized their impact on World War I, but Campanias helped usher in a new concept in naval warfare-ship-based offensive aircraft.",

From the first weeks of the War until the Armistice, the series of Albatros reconnaissance aircraft was deployed in large numbers on all fronts by the German and Austro-Hungarian Air Forces. As the lineage progressed, its successive variants were equipped with ever more powerful engines, improved internal framing, along with increases in weight, size, and wing span. Despite these alterations, all the variants retained the same general appearance and the same excellent flight characteristics.\n\nThe C.X entered service in 1917 on the heels of its predecessor, the C.VII. The C.X included a larger fuselage, which provided space for the installation of an oxygen system in the pilot's forward cockpit, and radio equipment in the rear cockpit. The aircraft was powered by a 260 hp Mercedes engine -a significant increase in power over its predecessor. The C.X's wingspan was also extended, and ailerons were added to all four wingtips in order to maintain its level of maneuverability.\n\nBy October of 1917, some 300 Albatros C.Xs were in operation with multiple German reconnaissance units. The aircraft continued to operate until the end of the War. The final variant in the Albatros lineage, the C.XII began to appear in late 1917. However, because the C.XII provided only minor improvements over the C.X and because the earlier aircraft had a substantially longer operational career, the C.X has been chosen to represent the entire Albatros lineage in this collection.",

    "history": "The Short Bomber claims the distinction of being the first aircraft, by itself, to attack and destroy a warship. In the early months of World War I, Britain lagged behind other countries in the construction of large heavy bombers capable of carrying large bomb loads over great distances. To address this deficiency, the British aircraft company, Short Brothers, created its \"Short Bomber\" as a transitional or \"stopgap\" aircraft. These machines filled the void until the British aircraft industry could produce true heavy bombers like the Handley-Page and Vickers machines. For a \"stopgap\" aircraft, the Short Bomber had an excellent career, especially considering its construction. With its single-engine design, the Short Bomber closely resembled an oversized fighter. \n\nEarly in the war, the Short Bomber achieved a noteworthy place in the history of military aviation. On August 15, 1915, a land-based Short Bomber of the Royal Navy Flying Service torpedoed and sank a Turkish cruiser in the Dardanelles. This action represented the beginning of the transition of naval power from the large caliber heavy guns of battleships and cruisers to weapons carried and delivered by warplanes.\n\nNine hundred Short Bombers were built for the British Royal Navy. Most served as torpedo bombers and a few as horizontal bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. The Short Bomber performed well enough that the British Royal Flying Corps took 89 of the machines for use as bombers on the Western front. By the middle of 1917 the Short Bombers were being replaced on the Western Front by more modern and capable multiple engine bombers. The naval variants, however, remained in service until the war's end in November 1918.",

    "history": "The Royal Aircraft Factory's F.E.2b was designed to provide the British Royal Flying Corps with an armed reconnaissance platform which could also perform as a fighter. Designed in 1914 in the era before engineering technology had established a means for firing a machine gun through a propeller arc without destroying the propeller, the R.A.F. F.E.2b was configured in a \"pusher\" configuration with the propeller mounted behind the cockpit. The aircraft had its twin machine guns positioned in its forward observer cockpit. The pilot was positioned in the rear of its fuselage, just ahead of the engine and propeller. \n\nThe machine first flew on January 26, 1915, only a few months after the outbreak of World War I. It entered service with squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps the following summer. Interestingly, the Royal Aircraft Factory, which designed the machine, built only 47 of the aircraft out of a total production of over 1,900. The vast majority were built under license by six other British aircraft firms. \n\nPerhaps the F.E. 2b's greatest moment in World War I came on June 18, 1916 when an F.E.2b shot down the famous German air ace, Max Immelmann. Despite the large number manufactured, the F.E. 2b's operational career as a reconnaissance fighter was relatively brief. By the latter part of 1916 it was becoming painfully clear that the pusher type of aircraft was inferior to that of fighters which had a \"tractor\" engine which pulled them through the air. The appearance of German Albatros fighters with this tractor configuration vividly proved this point. As a result, after little more than a year's service on the Western Front in the role for which they were designed, the machines were withdrawn to England for home defense or were relegated to night bombing. Despite their obsolescence, numbers of R.A.F. F.E.2bs remained in active duty with the Royal Flying Corps in these secondary roles until the Armistice on November 11, 1918.",

The aircraft acquired the name, \"de Havilland\", after its designer, Geoffery de Havilland, who would subsequently go on to develop and head one of England's most distinguished aircraft companies; a company which produced military and civilian aircraft throughout the twentieth century. \n\nThe D.H.2 was a direct descendent of the D.H.1, a two seat reconnaissance machine also designed by de Havilland. The smaller, single-seat D.H.2 was otherwise very similar in both appearance and construction to its predecessor. Its fuselage and wings consisted of fabric stretched over wood framing. The aircraft had a single forward-firing Lewis machine gun in the nose with the engine and propeller in a \"pusher\" position behind the pilot, thus giving the machine gun a free field of forward fire. \n\nThe first prototype D.H.2 flew on June 1, 1915 and the first production models entered service on the Western Front a month later with the 5th Wing of the British Royal Flying Corps. The D.H.2 proved to be a stable, durable and successful fighter. A machine of No.24 Squadron achieved the first Western Front D.H.2 air victory on August 9, 1915.

The aircraft's immediate predecessor, the B.E.12, was designed as a single seat fighter. The B.E.12 utilized essentially the same airframe as the earlier B.E.2c, but modified to accommodate a larger engine and better armament. Unfortunately, without further modifications to the airframe, the first B.E.12s proved sluggish in the air, making them ill-suited for fighter missions. The R.A.F attempted, but failed to significantly improve on the 12's performance with the updated 12a and, by early 1918, the poorly competitive B.E.12s were withdrawn from the Western Front and returned to England for home defense. \n\nIn 1917, the Royal Aircraft Factory made one last effort to upgrade its B.E.12-with the B.E.12b. The most powerful aircraft in the series, the \"b\" model featured the new 200 hp Hispano-Suiza engine, which was the same used in the highly successful S.E.5a fighters. Unlike its predecessors, the B.E.12b was designed primarily for home defense. It was equipped with twin Lewis guns mounted on the upper wing, including one with a Hutton illuminated sight. \n\nB.E.12bs finally entered service in February of 1918 as interceptors defending London against German Zeppelins and bombers. By this phase of the war, German Zeppelin air raids were rare and so the B.E.12bs had few targets. Seeking to utilize the machines, the British Air Ministry outfitted most of the B.E.12bs with bombs and employed them in anti-submarine patrols along the coast. This model replicates one of these coastal defense B.E. 12bs. By War's end, well over a hundred 12bs were built, but only 39 ever reached their units, 36 of which were employed in home defense.",

    "history": "With the outbreak of World War I, the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) realized a need for a fast, single-seat seaplane. To meet this need, the RNAS adapted the winner of the 1914 Schneider Trophy (a seaplane race) for military use. The winning aircraft, which was a seaplane variant of the Sopwith Tabloid, became known as the \"Schneider\". The aircraft was deployed in naval reconnaissance missions, and as a zeppelin interceptor. In September of 1915, a new version of the Schneider was developed. The variant, which was nicknamed the Sopwith Baby, included a more powerful 110 hp engine and redesigned forward fuselage characterized by its horseshoe-shaped engine cowling. \n\nThe Baby also differed from its predecessor in its armament. While Schneiders were typically equipped with a single Lewis gun, angled to fire above the propeller arc, the Babies utilized a propeller-synchronized machine gun. Some later models were also provided a second machine gun. A number of Babies were equipped with Rankin explosive darts in place of guns for making anti-shipping attacks and at least one (the prototype of this model) was armed with 10 Le Prieur rockets. In this last configuration, five rockets were attached to the outboard bracing struts of the machine's wings. \n\nA total of 286 Babies were manufactured in Great Britain during World War I. Of these, 195 were built, under license, by the British aircraft firm Blackburn. Although identical to the Sopwith machines, they were often referred to as \"Blackburn Babies\". The Baby was also built, under license, by the Italian firm Ansaldo. Babies saw wide service throughout the War. They operated not only from costal bases, but were among the first aircraft to be deployed from capital ships and from Great Britain's early seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers. Babies were employed in a wide variety of mission roles -as fighters, reconnaissance platforms, anti-submarine and anti-shipping aircraft, and Zeppelin interceptors. The careers of the Babies essentially ended at the conclusion of World War I with a few lingering on in secondary service -all were all gone by 1920.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The corrosive effect of sea water caused severe weathering of seaborne aircraft, especially to their undersurfaces and pontoons.

    "history": "British pilots nicknamed April of 1917, \"Bloody April\" in reference to the incredibly high losses they suffered during the course of the month. The German Albatros D.III fighter played a significant part in the British air losses that April. Several German aces flew the D.III that April, including Manfred von Richthofen -better known as, \"the Red Baron\"- Werner Voss, Ernst Udet, Eduard von Schleich and Bruno Lorzer.\n\nThe Albatros D.III was designed as a successor to the D.II and was built by its parent company Albatroswerke GmbH at Schneidemuhl, Germany. The project utilized data gathered from captured Nieuport Scouts and was launched in an effort to restore air superiority to the Central Powers.\n\nDesign and production of the new Albatros machine took place under the direction of Robert Thelen, an Albatros senior engineer. He adapted the sesquiplane style 11/2 V-strut wing of the highly successful French Nieuport Nie.17. He combined this wing with the semi-monocoque varnished plywood fuselage of his earlier Albatros D.II and installed within his new D.III fighter the Mercedes D.IIIa supercharged engine. The new engine gave the D.III excellent power and performance at high altitudes. \n\nThe prototype D.III first flew in August of 1916, but wing failures due to excessive flexibility of its lower wing required structural alterations. These delays meant that the new aircraft did not reach operational combat units until the following December. The first unit to receive the D.III was Jasta 1, commanded by Manfred von Richthofen. By the spring of 1917, thirty-seven Jasta had been supplied with the D.III. The presence of the new aircraft shifted the balance of air superiority to the Central Powers. \n\nProduction of the D.III continued until early 1918 after some 800 had been built. Manufacturing at Albatros was then shifted to their newer Albatros D.V and D.Va variants. Although given an even more powerful engine and improved aerodynamic styling, the D.V and D.Va were only marginally better than the D.III from which they were derived. The Albatros D.III remained competitive and served alongside its successors until the last day of World War I.",

    "history": "The Otto C.I is an aircraft which has been largely lost in the annals of World War I history. Reports indicate that somewhere between three and nineteen C.Is were manufactured. As such, their obscurity is understandable. \n\nThe Otto C.I was a \"pusher\" type biplane (with its engine and propeller at the rear), designed and built by Gustav Otto and his aviation company, Flugmaschinen-Werke Gustav Otto, based in Munich, Bavaria. Indeed, Bavaria had its own Air Force- the Royal Bavarian Flying Corps and was somewhat independent of Germany. The Otto C.I prototype's framing and inter-plane struts were made of duralumin, not wood -advanced for the time. But most unusual were the Otto C.I's twin booms supporting its tail surfaces. The first prototype flew in May of 1915 with production aircraft being delivered to the Royal Bavarian Air Corps shortly thereafter. \n\nThe planes were immediately unpopular with their crews due to very sluggish performance and lack of mobility when attempting to evade enemy fighters. This was primarily the result of the substitution of steel for intended duralumin in the construction of the production models. The added weight this substitution inflicted was significant. \n\nOtto C.Is had very brief combat careers and were quickly withdrawn from operational service by the Bavarian Air Corps, which modified some into training aircraft. The majority of the remaining C.Is were transferred to Germany's ally, Bulgaria, who initially deployed them in their intended role of reconnaissance However, by the spring of 1917, the Bulgarians also recognized the machines' deficiencies and restricted them to training duties.",

    "title": "Felixstowe F.2A",
    "history": "The Felixstowe F.2A was one of the largest flying boats of World War I. Its design and construction borrowed heavily from the American Curtiss H-12 and H-16 flying boats. Despite being complicated, time-consuming and expensive to build, the British Royal Flying Corps received 170 Felixstowe F.2As from November 1917 through March 1918.\n\nThe Felixstowe F.2A provided Britain with a long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft. It patrolled the North Sea, monitoring the German High Seas Fleet and attacking German submarines. World War I historical records contain little about the operational successes or failures of the machines overall. Although the outcome of the attack is obscure, Felixstowe F.2A No. 4543 (modeled here) attacked a German U-boat with its bombs on July 9, 1918.\n\nImprovements in German naval fighters, however, threatened these large, slow flying boats. The fighters exploited a flaw in the F.2A's defenses. Machine guns in the rear fuselage could not fire to the rear least they damage the aircraft's tail. British engineers later corrected this defensive \"blind spot\" by installing an additional dual machine gun mount in the middle of the upper wing. A special cupola provided this upper wing gunner with an ideal 360 degree field of fire.\n\nThe Felixstowe F.2A impacted the design of later British aircraft. It represents the first military-built \"fortress boat.\" Its defensive design established a basic formula for British flying boats through World War II. The Felixstowe F.2A's incredibly reliable engines also inspired the design of later British powerplants. These engines were the forerunner of the World War II Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, which powered numerous British aircraft including the Supermarine Spitfire, the Hawker Hurricane, the de Havilland Mosquito and the Avro Lancaster.",

    "history": "Despite its limited use during World War I, the Vickers Vimy represents the beginning of a long line of British Vickers bombers which served through World War II and even the \"Cold War\" of the late 20th Century. The Vimy, which was designed to have a range capable of bombing Berlin and other major German cities, entered development in the spring of 1917. The Vimy achieved its long range by relying on two Rolls-Royce engines which could function for hours without difficulty.\n\nThe first Vimy prototype flew on November 30, 1917 and the British Air Ministry immediately placed an order for 150 machines and later increased it to1,130. Given the size and the expense of the Vimy, this order was extraordinary. The Royal Flying Corps received only three Vimys, however, prior to the German capitulation in November 1918. These were still completing training with their new crews when the War ended and no Vimys carried out operational bombing raids during the War. After the War's conclusion, the Air Ministry reduced its large wartime order for Vimys to only 221 aircraft. \n\nNo longer needed for the war effort, the Vimy participated in many post-war endurance flights, including the first non-stop trans-Atlantic flight. In June 1919, British pilots John Alcock and Arthur Whitten-Brown flew a specially modified Vimy 1,890 miles (3,042 km) from St. Johns, Newfoundland, to Clifden, Northern Ireland. Six months later, in December 1919, the Australian pilots and brothers Ross and Keith Smith flew a Vimy from England to Australia in a multiple segment flight of 11,130 miles (17,912 km).",

    "history": "The LFG Roland C.II represents a versatile German aircraft built by the aviation company LFG Roland. Just prior to the outbreak of World War I, the German aircraft company, Luftfahrzeug Gesellschaft (LFG), adopted the trade name \u201cRoland\u201d in order to avoid any confusion with another German aircraft firm Luft-Verkehrs GmbH (LVG). Prior to the name change in 1915, the LFG engineers designed and built the LFG Roland C.II, a revolutionary and streamlined biplane meant to serve as a reconnaissance aircraft. The C.II, however, was armed and could also function as a fighter. This unique craft was nicknamed \u201cWalfisch\" (German for \"whale\").\n\nUnlike most biplanes of the era, both wings of the LFG Roland C.II attached directly to the fuselage. This arrangement eliminated the need for center section struts and reduced the wing\u2019s rigging requirements, thus achieving reduced drag and a strengthened upper wing. The C.II also featured a special semi-monocoque fuselage. Each half of the fuselage was formed in a mold with alternate layers of a thin spruce veneer and fabric, each applied at an acute angle and glued one to the other to create the fuselage. The result was a light and very strong structure. The machine, however, did possess a few problems. Because the space between its wings was narrower than usual, the aircraft stalled easily. The Roland C.II\u2019s thin wings were also prone to break under severe stress. \n\nDespite these drawbacks, the Roland C.II became highly successful as a long range reconnaissance craft during the early months of World War I. With its mounted machine gun, it could serve for both defense and offense at a time when many of the aircraft of both sides were either poorly armed or unarmed. Given its speed and successful performance, a fighter version of the C.II Walfisch was later designated, the LFG Roland D.I. This machine had only one seat, was slightly smaller, and included two fixed forward firing synchronized LMG 08/15 machine guns.\n\nBy 1917, the LFG Roland C.IIs became obsolete in the face of improved Allied fighters. They were withdrawn from active reconnaissance roles and were transferred to German flight schools where they served as duel seat trainers for the remainder of the War.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The C.II modeled here replicates the one piloted by Oberleutnant Ritter von Schleich.

The W 29 made use of the W 12's fuselage, but switched to a low-winged monoplane configuration. The prototype W 29's also sported a new 195 hp Benz engine. This was replaced in production models by the 150 hp Benz, which powered late-model W.12s. The W 29's fuselage was of wood framing covered with a smooth plywood veneer. Thin metal alloy surrounded its engine and radiator. Its wings and tail surfaces were fabric covered and its pontoons were metal. Like its predecessor the W.12, the W 29 had an unconventional inverted rudder, designed to provide the gunner with a clear rearward field of fire.\n\nDespite its unorthodox appearance, the seventy-plus known W 29 floatplane fighters, which were manufactured, delivered very impressive performance and became a significant factor in the skies over the North Sea.

    "history": "The Royal Aircraft Factory (R.A.F.) at Farnborough was established from the H.M. Balloon Factory to design, build and test new aircraft. However, the facility drew a great deal of criticism because it often created its \"new\" designs by essentially rebuilding salvaged aircraft from other manufacturers. During World War I, Geoffrey de Havilland designed a series of \"B.E.\" designated aircraft. The \"B.E.\" acronym stood for \"Bl\u00e9riot Experimental\", because the aircraft were based on the designs of the famous French aviation pioneer, Louis Bl\u00e9riot. \n\nThe B.E.2 was the second aircraft in the series, but differed little from its predecessor, the B.E.1. The B.E.2a modeled here had wood framing with doped fabric covering except for varnished plywood about the cockpit and metal sheeting about the engine. It employed wing warping for lateral control. The aircraft also\nfeatured an air-cooled inline engine. This saved substantial weight and improved performance over aircraft with liquid-cooled engines. \n\nThe B.E.2a first flew in the second week of August, 1912 when it took part in the British Military Trials on Salisbury Plain in England. It outperformed all its competition and British military leaders immediately placed production orders. Although over 3,100 B.E.2 aircraft were built by the end of World War I, only five prototype B.E.2a's were built by the R.A.F. The majority of the type were built under license by other British aircraft firms, including Armstrong Whitworth, Handley Page, British Colonial and Vickers. \n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, B.E. 2a reconnaissance aircraft were sent to France along with the British Expeditionary Force. Among these was B.E. 2a No. 336, modeled here. A Vickers built machine, it went to France on August 13, 1914 and was one of the first aircraft of the War fitted with wireless communication equipment. \n\nBy late 1916 the B.E.2a had been replaced in France by newer and far more competitive aircraft. Among these replacements were several newer R.A.F. machines designed by Geoffrey de Havilland. The B.E.2s returned to England where they were deployed in home defense and as trainers. By 1918 they had largely disappeared from military service. Some lingered on following the War in a variety of civilian uses.",

Among these were a number of Maurice Farman M.F.7 aircraft. These aircraft were designed in early 1913 by the young French aeronautical engineer, Maurice Farman. Although they were originally intended for sale on the civilian market, the Aviation Militaire (French Air Force) bought a number of the machines to serve as reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe M.F.7's construction was similar to that of many aircraft designed in the years immediately prior to the war. The plane was designed as a biplane with a forward canard wing, which connected to and acted in concert with its tail control surfaces. A central gondola-like fuselage seated the crew and housed a copper petrol tank and the aircraft's pusher engine. Its framing was made entirely of wood and it was covered with doped fabric except for the top of its gondola which was covered with a varnished wood veneer. The machine was a maze of wooden spars and struts, steel bracing wires and control cables. This gave the M.F.7 a fragile appearance, although it was a rather robust machine. \n\nSix escadrilles fielded the M.F.7 at the start of the War. While the aircraft began as reconnaissance machines, some escadrilles also used them as bombers and even fighters. The M.F.7 remained in front-line service until early 1915 when is began to be replaced by the improved M.F.11. Many of the aircraft, which were known for their easy handling, were redeployed as trainers and served in this capacity until 1917. The Maurice Farman M.F.7 remains noteworthy in the annals of military aviation history because it was one of the first aircraft to be deployed in warfare.",

    "history": "In April of 1918, the German High Command held a competition to select a new single-seat fighter. German firm, Fokker Aeroplanbau GmbH submitted a modified version of Reinhold Platz's prototype, the E.V as their entry. The High Command selected Fokker's parasol-winged monoplane to enter production, and ordered 400 of the fighters. \n\nThe first E.Vs joined the fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 6 on the Western Front during the last week of July in 1918. Unfortunately, these initial units were plagued with structural problems. The machines' cantilevered wings began breaking up in midair, resulting in pilot deaths. All Fokker E.Vs were grounded on August 24, 1918, and a panel of inquiry was formed. Two theories for the wing failure developed. One suggested that extra reinforcement added to the wings reduced their flexibility and caused them to fracture under stress. The other suggested that, after the wing spars were attached, the joints were smoothed down too far, weakening the attachment points.\n\nTo address these problems, the wings of the existing machines were retrofitted, and changes were instituted in the manufacturing of new aircraft. The aircraft was re-designated the Fokker D.VIII and returned to combat just 3 weeks prior to the armistice. Given its brief career, the D.VIII achieved few combat victories. \n\nFollowing the war, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles denied these planes to Germany. At least two became a part of the newly created Polish Air Force and saw action against the Bolshevik Red Army. Other of these aircraft were evaluated and deployed by France, Canada, and the Netherlands. Single aircraft were tested, but never used, by Italy and the United States.",

    "history": "The German firm, Allgemeine Elektizit\u00e4ts Gesellschaft (A.E.G) designed the D.I as a new fast and highly maneuverable fighter aircraft for the German Air Force. The new machine was the product of a collaboration between George Konig, A.E.G.'s chief design engineer, and Walter Hohndorf, a decorated German World War I ace and famous test pilot who brought his considerable flying and combat experience to the project. \n\nThe A.E.G. D.I incorporated a number of unique features in its design. Its airframe was built entirely of steel tubing, rare at a time when almost all aircraft framing was wood. Further, a single steel spar supported the entire length of its wings making it possible to greatly reduce the supplemental wing bracing so common on other contemporary biplane aircraft. At Hohndorf's insistence, the aircraft also included an enormous exhaust pipe exiting the engine along the starboard side of the fuselage and extending behind the cockpit. The pipe was included in order to reduce distracting and deafening engine noise. \n\nThe new fighter made its first appearance in May of 1917 and formal flight evaluations began at the German Air Force's test facility at Adlershot, Germany on June 28, 1917. The aircraft exhibited excellent maneuverability coupled with a speed of nearly 130 mph in level flight -among the fastest of all World War I aircraft. On August 21, 1917, in the course of its evaluation, a prototype D.I was placed into strenuous flight maneuvers by the highly skilled test pilot Lieutenant Julius Hendricks. During these maneuvers the machine went into a steep uncontrolled dive and crashed, killing Hendricks. Since the new fighter had displayed significant promise, testing of the D.I continued despite the crash. \n\nTo further evaluate the A.E.G. D.I under actual combat conditions on the Western Front, at least one prototype was sent to Jasta 14, a fighter unit commanded by Hohndorf himself. On September 5, 1917, when flying the fighter he had helped design (No. D 4400 modeled here), Hohndorf crashed and was killed. An investigation revealed he crashed due to a mechanical failure of the aircraft. \n\nWith the death of two outstanding and experienced pilots blemishing its record, Idflieg (the German Air Force High Command) canceled the A.E.G. D.I program.

    "history": "Early in World War I both Germany and its ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, designated their reconnaissance aircraft as \"C-class\" machines, a policy which extended throughout the War. In late 1915 the German aircraft manufacturing company Deutsche Flugzeug Werke (D.F.W.) began designing a new C-class reconnaissance platform -the D.F.W. C.V. The new aircraft first flew in May of 1916 and began equipping operational units of the German Air Force the following summer. The success of the machine can be best judged by the fact that about 1,000 were built during the War -the most of any single German aircraft type. \n\nThe C.V was constructed with wood framing covered by a doped fabric skin, but its engine was enclosed in a rounded aerodynamically smooth metal cowling. The cowling was unusual at a time when the cylinder heads of inline engines were usually open and exposed to an aircraft's slip stream. The D.F.W. C.V was highly regarded by its crews and respected for its speed, maneuverability, toughness and reliability. In the hands of a skilled pilot the D.F.W. C.V was agile enough that it could escape most Allied fighters. This meant it could operate independently without the need of a fighter escort -a distinct advantage. The machine saw extensive service and became the \"workhorse\" of German aerial reconnaissance. Not until the late summer of 1918 did more modern reconnaissance aircraft begin to replace it. However, the sheer numbers of D.F.W. C.Vs in service made the transition a slow process. Further, many German airman preferred the older C.V to newer machines.",

    "history": "The Nieuport X (Nie. X) was the first aircraft in a lineage of fighters developed by the French aviation firm \u00c9tablissements Nieuport. The Nie. X was not originally designed as a military aircraft but was, rather, intended to be the French entry in the 1914 International Gordon-Bennett Air Race. When the race was cancelled at the outbreak of World War I, Nieuport modified the aircraft into a fighter. Despite the War, the Aviation Militaire (French Air Force) initially showed little interest in the Nie. X, but the British Royal Naval Air Service did. The British purchased and placed 24 of the machines into service. \n\nThe first military versions of the Nie. X were two seat aircraft with a pilot and an observer/gunner. The airframe consisted of fabric-covered wood framing except for a thin metal cowling about the engine and forward fuselage. The aircraft was of sesquiplane design -its lower wing having less than half the area of its upper wing. Nieuport eventually converted the Nie. X into a single seat fighter with a single machine gun mounted atop the upper wing to fire over the propeller arc. With the development of the single-seat version, and after the pressures of war had clearly demonstrated the need for fighter aircraft, the Aviation Militaire changed its attitude and placed a sizeable order for the single-seat Nieuport X. \n\nThe Nieuport X not only equipped British and French squadrons, but was also flown by the Belgians, Italians and Russians who built the fighter under license. However, the \"heyday\" of the Nie. X was brief. It entered combat service in May of 1915, but was gradually being replaced by its immediate successor, the Nieuport 11, by the early months of 1916. Nevertheless, the Nieuport X holds a special place in the historical annals of World War I as the first in the distinguished lineage of famous Nieuport fighters. \n\nThe Nie. X modeled here was flown by Flt. Commander Reginald Bone, commanding officer of RNAS Detling. While flying his Nie. X, on March 19, 1916, Bone shot down one of the six German Friedrichshafen bombers that were attacking the English coastal cities of Dover, Deal and Ramsgate. For this action he received the Distinguished Service Order.",

    "history": "In the summer of 1916 Italian aircraft designers Umberto Savoia, Rodolfo Verduzio and Celestino Rosatelli set out to design a new high-performance fighter aircraft for the Italian Corpo Aeronautico Militare. The task of manufacturing the aircraft was assigned to the Societa Giovanni Ansaldo. When the single-seat biplane was finished, it received the designation Ansaldo S.V.A. 5 (Savoia-Verduzio-Ansaldo) in recognition of its manufacturer and chief designers.\n\nThe first S.V.A. 5 flew on March 19, 1917. Biplanes with wood framing, the S.V.A. had varnished plywood covering the fuselage, doped fabric covering the wings and tail surfaces and a metal alloy surrounding the engine. The aircraft's intra-wing bracing arrangement was unusual and employed a Warren truss triangular configuration of thin steel struts, devoid of bracing wires. \n\nThe new S.V.A. aircraft exhibited exceptional speed but lacked the maneuverability desirable in combat fighters. However, it was recognized that they would make exceptional high speed reconnaissance bombers, a role to which they were immediately assigned and in which they excelled. Despite carrying a bomb load, two machine guns and two reconnaissance cameras, the S.V.A. 5 was one of the fastest aircraft of War and was probably one of the conflict's finest reconnaissance platforms. Its speed alone made it largely immune to interception and once released from its bomb load, it became competitive with Austro-Hungarian fighters. \n\nOf the 1,248 aircraft of the S.V.A. series manufactured during the War, the Ansaldo S.V.A. 5, modeled here, was built in the largest numbers. A two-seat variant of the S.V.A. 5 was soon developed and designated the S.V.A. 9 The Ansaldo S.V.A.'s greatest moment came on August 8, 1918 when 10 S.V.A. 5's lead by a single S.V.A. 9 over-flew Vienna, Austria for over a half hour dropping bombs and leaflets all while taking photographs of the city. This constituted a nonstop round-trip flight of over 6 hours, covering 620 miles (998 km) from their base in Pelagio, Italy -an exceptional feat for the time. Ansaldo S.V.A. 5 aircraft rendered impressive service until the end of the War and numbers of them continued flying with the Italian Corpo Aeronautico Militare until the mid-1930s.",

While its chief enemy Germany and even its Russian ally had such machines in operation in the early weeks of the conflict, it was not until the middle of the War that England had it's first big bombers (The Handley Page O/100 and O/400) and not until the end of the that the Blackburn Kangaroo was put into service.\n\nIn retaliation for air raids over English cities, the British High Command was intent on obtaining even better long range bombers which could attack German cities and the German industrial complex. Near the end of the War the Blackburn Kangaroo bomber was designed and built in response to these British War Office specifications. The Kangaroo developed from the earlier G.P. and S.P. seaplanes built by the British Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company for maritime reconnaissance. The Kangaroos utilized wheeled undercarriages in place of the seaplanes' pontoons. The Kangaroo had a long and slender fuselage which did not allow for crew movement from one position to another. This was a design concern should the pilot become incapacitated during flight. In this configuration, Kangaroos were delivered to both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. Eleven of fifteen Blackburn Kangaroos were placed into active service prior to the War's end. \n\nKangaroos were primarily deployed in maritime patrols over the North Sea. On such missions, Kangaroos were reported as having sunk one German submarine and having heavily damaged four others. The machines also deployed to Belgium with a bomber squadron tasked with attacking land targets within Germany. Many of these aircraft survived the War and were subsequently converted into civilian transports. They were all retired by the late 1920s.",

The U.S. instead equipped its pilots with French and British models, while working to develop its domestic aviation industry. American military leaders put out a call for an American built fighter. Two firms responded with original designs: the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan with their LUSAC-11, and the Standard Aircraft Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey with the Standard M-Defense. \n\nThe Standard's design began in May of 1917. Two prototypes of the new fighter, called the Standard M-Defense, were delivered to the Army Air Corps the following summer. During preproduction flight trials it became apparent that the new aircraft lacked the performance characteristics necessary for a fighter. It was underpowered, slow, lacked maneuverability and had a sluggish rate of climb. The little biplane would be unable to compete with the latest German fighters then in service on the Western Front. \n\nWith minor changes the aircraft was instead adopted as an advanced trainer, the Standard E-1 which is modeled here. 168 production E.1s were manufactured and assigned to flight Schools within the continental United States. A total of 130 E-1 aircraft were eventually produced for the U.S. Army Air Corps.\n\nAfter the War, Lawrence Sperry converted a number of E.1s to unmanned \"aerial torpedoes\" as part of a series of military tests now recognized as one of the earliest manifestations of guided-missle technology.",

Unlike some of the manufacturer's earlier aircraft, which were first developed for civilian use, the Type AC was designed specifically as a fighter. While retaining the shoulder-positioned monoplane configuration of its predecessors, it differed from them by employing ailerons instead of wing-warping for lateral control. Free of the need for wing-warping, the aircraft's single wing had rigid bracing on its underside. The new Morane-Saulnier Type AC was very aerodynamically clean by standards of the time. Its fuselage was faired to a circular cross section, a large, smooth spinner held its two bladed propeller and its control cables were all internal and a single machine gun was mounted atop the forward fuselage. The first Type AC prototype flew in the late summer of 1916. Its performance was felt to be competitive with that of any Allied fighter then in service. \n\nThe Aviation Militaire ordered thirty production models, which began equipping French fighter Escadrille in late 1916. The Morane-Saulnier Type AC had excellent performance but had the misfortune of entering service at the same time as the new S.P.A.D. S.VII biplane fighter. The AC was deemed slightly inferior to the new S.P.A.D. and so only the original thirty machines were ever manufactured. World War I aviation records are vague about the operational history of the Morane-Saulnier Type AC fighters but it is known that they remained in active combat service until the spring of 1917.  They were then replaced by S.P.A.D. S.XIII fighters, which had joined S.VIIs and Neuports, as the principle fighter aircraft of the Aviation Militaire. It is further known that two ACs were supplied to the British Royal Flying Corps for evaluation but there is no record that either were deployed operationally.",

    "history": "The Morane-Saulnier Type N was among the first operational single seat fighters in the world. Its maiden flight was in May of 1914, three months before the outbreak of World War I. Originally designed for sale on the civilian market to wealthy sportsmen who wanted to \"fly\", the advent of World War I prompted the French military to order numbers of the machines for the Aviation Militaire. The Morane-Saulnier Type N had its military operational debut on the Western front when flown in the early summer of 1915 by the famous French pilot Eugene Gilbert.\n\nThe Type N was a shoulder-wing monoplane, unusual at a time when most airplanes had multiple sets of wings. It employed wing warping for lateral control requiring its wings to have multiple bracing wires on both its superior and inferior surfaces. \n\nOn later production aircraft, the solitary machine gun was positioned on the upper forward fuselage and was fixed to fire through the propeller arc. To avoid damage, the back of the propeller was fitted with steel plates which deflected those bullets striking it during firing. This approach was first installed, tested and flown in combat by Roland Garros in a Morane-Saulnier Type L. \n\nThe French dubbed the Type N fighter <i>\"Le Vengeur\"</i> (The Avenger). The Morane-Saulnier Type N saw substantial service with the Aviation Militaire, both as an observation platform and as a fighter during 1915, but by the end of that year it began to be phased out in favor of more modern and better aircraft. However, the Type N remained in active combat for some months thereafter in the hands of France's allies. Between March and June of 1916 twenty-four Morane-Saulnier Type N aircraft were placed into service by the British Royal Flying Corps where they acquired the nickname \"Morane Bullets\". The Russian Military Air Fleet also deployed Type N aircraft which were sent to Russia by France following their removal from front line service by the Aviation Militaire. Britain and Russia retired all of their Type N machines by early 1917.",

    "history": "The SPAD XIII achieved incredible success during World War I. Louis Bechereau, the chief engineer of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pour L'Aviation et ses D\u00e9riv\u00e9s (SPAD), designed several successful aircraft in this line, beginning with the SPAD VII. The new S.13 employed many of the same features of the S.7. Both aircraft included single-bay, interplane bracing, rod-and-crank aileron control, and a circular radiator located immediately behind the propeller. The new S.13 also made several improvements to the original design of the S.7. The S.13 was larger and faster. It possessed a more powerful engine, heavier armament and a completely different internal structure which made it far more robust. The S.13 prototype first flew on April 4, 1917. It performed exceptionally, and production began immediately.\n\nBy April of 1918, the French Aviation Militaire had 372 S.13s in operation. The fighter proved to be highly successful and more than a match for Germany\u2019s Albatros and Pfalz fighters. The S.13 performed so highly that it replaced most of France\u2019s older S.7s and many of its newer Nieuport fighters. By the final months of the War, it equipped 80 French fighter escadrilles on the Western Front. \n\nThe SPAD S.13 also proved successful in the services of other countries. Eleven squadrons of the British, Belgian, Italian and American Air Forces adopted the new French fighter. It even replaced Sopwith fighters in some British units. Only the Italians retained numbers of the older S.7s in their air service, as some Italian pilots preferred their S.7s to the newer and heavier S.13s. \n\nOverall, the demand for the new S.13 was so great that no less than eight French aviation companies, in addition to its parent firm, built the machines. Total production reached 8,472 aircraft. Several Allied aces flew the S.13 on their way to fame in the skies over France. The S.13 was the final SPAD fighter designed during World War I and concluded this highly successful line of aircraft.",

    "title": "Pfalz Dr.I",
    "history": "The Pfalz Dr.I was a single-seat triplane, which represented Pfalz Flugzeugwerke's answer to the German Idflieg's (Inspectorate of Flying Troops) call for triplane fighters -the same request which resulted in the infamous Fokker Dr.I. Inspired by the success of the British Sopwith Triplane, German designers hoped that adding a third wing to an aircraft would improve its lift, climb rate and maneuverability.\n\nThe new Pfalz machine was essentially a D.VII fitted with a third wing. The two aircraft shared the same armament and the same 160 hp Siemens-Halske rotary engine. The middle wing of the Dr.I was half the cord of the upper and lower wings, and unlike the clean lines of the Fokker triplane, retained an array of bracing wires. The Pfalz Dr.I otherwise exhibited typical World War I construction with wood framing throughout. A smooth plywood veneer covered its fuselage and fabric covered its wings and tail surfaces. \n\nFlight trials of the first prototype yielded sufficient promise that a preproduction batch of ten machines was ordered by the German High Command. These arrived on the Western Front in early April of 1918 but their pilots found them to have little to no advantage over the latest variants of the German Albatros and Fokker fighters already in service. There is some indication that the Pfalz triplane possessed a better climb rate than the Fokker Dr.I -making it best suited for bomber intercept missions. However, a lack of improved performance combined with frequent engine problems halted production after the first batch. \n\nDespite their shortcomings, the existing ten aircraft served in German fighter units until the Armistice ended World War I on November 11, 1918 -just seven months after the Pfalz Dr.I's introduction into service.",

Designed by Ernst Heinkel, for aviation firm, Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke , the W 12 was distinguished by its unique tail configuration -the vertical stabilizer on the W 12 extended below the fuselage instead of above. This configuration provided the aircraft's gunner with a clear field of fire. This unorthodox tail structure would be repeated on several later seaplane designs.\n\nThe W 12 first appeared in early 1917 and began equipping the German seaplane station at Zeebrugge, Belgium where they engaged in patrols over the English Channel. On December 11, 1917 a W 12 piloted by station commander, Friedrick Christiansen downed the British Airship C27. \n\nA total of 145 W 12s had been built when production ended in June of 1918.

Gustav Budig, Rumpler's chief design engineer for the entire \"C\" series, designed the C.X with a unique x-shaped wing strut, which reduced the need for additional bracing wires. The C.X incorporated a pine wood frame covered with a fabric skin, except for the metal sheeting around the forward fuselage. The aircraft was powered by a 240 hp Maybach Mb IV engine, and was designed to carry a forward-firing Spandau machinegun and a movable Parebellum gun. Overall, the two seat biplane exhibited clean lines and was a light, aerodynamically efficient machine.\n\nThe C.X made its maiden flight in 1918. Unfortunately, after the prototype was seriously damaged in a collision on the ground, further design and production was cancelled. The end of the War later that year, eliminated the need for further aircraft development, marking the end of Rumpler's \"C\" type lineage.",

    "history": "The Avro 504 represents the only military aircraft of World War I to serve in frontline combat from the first to the final day of the War. The 504 was designed by the British aviation pioneer Alliot Verdon Roe, founder of the A.V. Roe & Company, Ltd. (Avro). It first flew in 1913 as a participant in a number of air races and in 1914 set a new unofficial altitude record of 15,000 feet. Small numbers of this craft were initially ordered by both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Navy Air Service. With the outbreak of World War I, demand for the highly successful aircraft was so great that several additional British aircraft firms besides Avro began production. \n\nVariants of the Avro 504 encompassed several different roles, serving as a reconnaissance craft, light bomber, trainer, fighter and night fighter. It was built in more different variants than any other British type. In all, over 10,000 were built-more than any other type of British warplane. The largest numbers of 504s served as trainers and in reconnaissance. These were two-seat machines. The fighter and bomber variants had their forward seat removed to allow for increased fuel capacity and to accommodate the added weight of a machine gun and its ammunition, or the weight of a bomb load. The K variant (modeled here) was fitted with universal engine-bearer struts allowing it to accept most of the new more powerful rotary engines which were becoming available.\n\nThe Avro 504 participated in several important milestones of the War. On August 22, 1914, an Avro 504 of No. 5 Squadron became the first British aircraft to be brought down by enemy fire. In November of 1914, 504s became the first British aircraft to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen, Germany. The 504 also represents the first British machine to function as a dedicated night fighter combating the German nighttime Zeppelin raids over London.\n\nAt the end of the War, the Royal Flying Corps possessed 2,999 Avro 504s in active service, more than any other British aircraft type. Following World War I, no fewer than 17 countries acquired and deployed Avro 504 aircraft in their air forces. Some of these aircraft even continued service into World War II. Several machines are airworthy to this day and are part of civilian historical aircraft collections or museums.",

    "history": "The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 and the later variant, the S.E.5a (modeled here), was a single-seat biplane fighter, known for its speed and durability. The aircraft was of standard construction for the time -wire-braced wooden box-girder fuselage and fabric-covered wings. It was armed with a Lewis gun mounted on the top wing, and a propeller-synchronized Vickers machine gun in front of the cock-pit. The S.E.5 was originally designed to carry the Hispano-Suiza 150 hp engine, which first appeared in 1915. Further development of the engine produced a 200 hp model in 1916. The more-powerful engine was installed on a modified version of the S.E.5, which was redesignated the S.E.5a.\n\nUnfortunately, the larger engine proved problematic. Production delays and frequent failures in the larger engines resulted in supply shortages. Engine failures in front-line aircraft, also had an adverse effect on pilot morale.\n\nNevertheless, the S.E.5a proved to be a formidable aircraft in combat. Though it was less maneuverable than its contemporaries, the machine's durability allowed its pilots to push the aircraft's capabilities without fear of structural failure. The S.E.5a notably served as the mount for several of Britain's top aces. The prototype for this model was an R.A.F. aircraft flown on the Western Front by William A. (Billie) Bishop; a Canadian who became one of Great Britain's highest scoring aviators. He was credited with 72 victories.\n\nBy the middle of 1918 the S.E.5a equipped 25 squadrons on the Western Front, three in Macedonia, two in Palestine, one in Mesopotamia and four in England for homeland defense. A total of over 5200 aircraft were produced. Thirty-five S.E.5a's were also given to the American Expeditionary Force, which flew them on the Western Front during the final months of the war. Soon after the war the British retired the S.E.5a in favor of the Sopwith Snipe, but it continued to serve in the United States Army Air Force until the mid 1920s. A number of the American machines were finally sold to civilians for use in \"barnstorming shows\" and \"flying circuses\". Several of the S.E.5a's also starred in the Hollywood movie <i>Hells Angels</i>.",

The Italian firm Societ\u00e0 Aeronautica Meccanica Lombarda (S.A.M.L.) responded with a new design drafted by two of its engineers, Umberto Savola and Rodolfo Verduzio. This duo and their team had previously designed the very successful Ansaldo S.V.A. reconnaissance aircraft which was deployed in large numbers with the Italian Air Force. \n\nThe initial version of the new aircraft, designated the SAML S.1, was based on Italian-built versions of the German Aviatik B.I. The aircraft was built around a six-cylinder liquid-cooled inline engine built by the Italian automotive manufacturing firm, Fiat. The SAML retained the Aviatik's \"heart-shaped\" horizontal stabilizer and mounted the engine \"German-style\" with the cylinders protruding above the engine housing. A short-spanned variant of the aircraft, designated the SAML S.2 (modeled here) followed soon after and, after successful flight trials, began equipping units of the Italian Air Force in the late summer of 1917. Although they lacked blazing speed, the SAML aircrafts' performance was otherwise satisfactory and the machines came to be highly regarded by their crews as robust, reliable and easy to fly. \n\nOver six-hundred SAML aircraft were produced and served with sixteen different reconnaissance units of the Italian Air Force during the War. The aircraft operated over the Italian, Austro-Hungarian, Albanian and Macedonian Fronts and remained in active frontline service until the end of World War I. \n\nThe fuselage sides of the SAML S.2, modeled here, display not only the traditional Italian recognition roundels but also its squadriglia (squadron) number (105) and a red rooster, the pilot's personal marking.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The aircraft depicted here is painted in the markings of 105a Squadriglia.

The first of these aircraft, the F.B.A. Model A, was heavily influenced by the earlier Donnet-L\u00e9v\u00eaque. Developed prior to World War I, the Model A did not see extensive military service. However, the F.B.A. Model B and Model C (modeled here) were produced in significant numbers for the French and British navies.\n\nThe F.B.A. Model B and C were larger, two-seat versions of their predecessor, The B and C differed only in their powerplants. The Model B employed a 100 hp Gn\u00f4me engine, while the Model C utilized a more powerful 130 hp Clerget engine. Both aircraft were two-seat biplane flying boats with their respective engines in a \"pusher\" configuration. The lower wing of the F.B.A. flying boats did not mount directly to the fuselage. Rather, it was elevated on four steel struts which dramatically raised the wings above the body of the craft.\n\nFirst produced in France, manufacture of F.B.A. flying boats was also carried out under license by the SIAI company in Italy and the Lebedev factory in Russia. During the course of the war no less than 982 F.B.A. flying boats were built, the largest number of any World War I flying boat type.

    "title": "de Havilland (Airco) D.H.9",
    "history": "The D.H.9 was the last in a series of aircraft designed by Geoffrey de Havilland, chief aeronautical engineer of the Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (Airco). Intended to improve upon de Havilland's highly successful D.H.4 bomber, the new D.H.9 was created in response to the British Air Board's plans to expand the country's air forces from 108 to 200 squadrons. \n\nThe D.H.9 differed from its predecessor only in its engine and cockpit configuration. The new bomber positioned the pilot closer to the gunner's position, which greatly improved the crew's ability to communicate in flight. The engine selected for the aircraft was the new new Armstrong Siddeley Puma engine. The new powerplant was originally rated at 300 h.p., but soon downgraded to 230 h.p. after experiencing problems defective cylinder blocks. This downgrade meant that the D.H.9 -intended as an improvement over the D.H.4- actually had less power than its predecessor. \n\nFollowing their introduction in January of 1918, fifty D.H.9s were promptly shot down and another 100 were damaged beyond repair, due in large part to their insufficient power. The disparity between the aircraft's original design and its operational performance prompted Major-General Hugh Trenchard, Chief of the British Air Ministry, to initiate an official inquiry. \n\nDespite deficiencies and combat losses, D.H.9s remained in front line service until the War's end. In an effort to correct the power problem, de Havilland installed the American built 400 hp (298 kw) 12 cylinder Liberty engine into the D.H.9 airframe. Dubbed the D.H.9A, the new variant achieved the performance de Havilland, Airco and the British Royal Flying Corps had been seeking. Unfortunately, the new variant did not reach service until the autumn of 1918 -too late to have an impact on the War. \n\nOver 2,500 D.H.9As were built, the vast majority during the decade following World War I. Post-War, D.H.9As not only flew for the British but were also sold to the air forces of the United States, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Latvia, Chile, Peru, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland, Greece and Romania. D.H.9A's were also deployed by both White and Red Russian forces during the 1917-1919 Russian Civil War. Some South African D.H.9As remained in front line operational service until 1938. \n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The D.H.9 modeled here (#B 7620) has white fuselage recognition stripes, the markings of No. 211 Squadron Leader J.A.

    "history": "The Morane-Saulnier Type L developed from the pre-war Type G to serve as an artillery spotter and reconnaissance aircraft. The Type L maintained the slab-sided fuselage, wing shape and wing-warping control method of its predecessor. However, the Type L switched to a parasol-style wing, which afforded better downward visibility for the aircraft's observer.\n\nEarly in World War I, the Type L quickly became the preferred mount over the Types G and H. Once operational, the aircraft was employed as an artillery spotter, light bomber and a fighter. The Type L's intended armament consisted of a single Lewis gun operated by the observer. In 1914, however, French pilot, Roland Garros became the first recorded pilot to mount a machine gun atop the fuselage to fire through the propeller. Garros used steel deflection plates to protect his propeller from the bullets. in April, 1915 Garros shot down three enemy aircraft in as many weeks. \n\nMore than 600 Morane Saulnier aircraft operated in combat with multiple Escadrilles over the Western Front before being replaced by more modern Nieuport and S.P.A.D. aircraft in late 1916. Many of France's leading aces, including George Marie Guynemer, experienced their first combat in the Morane-Saulnier Type L and it is considered by some to be the grandfather of fighter aircraft.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts a modified Type L with a forward-firing machine gun.

    "history": "The Ph\u00f6nix C.I was developed as a replacement for the Hansa-Brandenburg C.II armed reconnaissance aircraft. Construction was typical for the era, consisting of wood framing throughout with a thin wood veneer covering the fuselage, sheet metal surrounding the engine and fabric covering over the remainder of the craft. The machine's rudder was unique. Most of the surface area of the rudder was below the horizontal tail. The rudder area above the horizontal tail was small, unobtrusive and gave the rear gunner an excellent field of fire.\n\nPreproduction flight trials in late 1917 proved the new Ph\u00f6nix C.I to be fast, tough and maneuverable with an outstanding rate of climb and excellent handling properties. The aircraft was especially effective when flying at high altitudes, an attribute which lead to its extensive deployment in high-altitude photographic reconnaissance sorties. \n\nProduction aircraft began equipping units of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force in the late spring of 1918. Flying largely over the Italian front, the C.Is immediately received praise from their crews. In June of 1918, a  Ph\u00f6nix C.I flown by Feldwebel (Sergeant) Max Kauer with Arnold Barwig as observer/gunner was attacked by a SPAD XIII fighter flown by Italy's leading air ace, Major Francesco Barraca. In the ensuing engagement the Italian was shot down and killed. This event proved that the Ph\u00f6nix C.I was not only a fine reconnaissance platform but also a dangerous opponent for the Allies' best fighter aircraft even when flown by their best aces. \n\nProduction of the Ph\u00f6nix C.I was terminated at the end of the war by which time just over 100 had been delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Air Force. Terms within the Armistice demanded that Austria-Hungary surrender all of its Ph\u00f6nix C.I aircraft to the victorious Allied nations.",

    "history": "Germany's first mass-produced military aircraft were called <i>Tauben</i> (Doves) -so named because of the bird-like shape of their wings. Austrian designer, Igo Etrich developed the first prototype <i>Taube</i>, before licensing the design the Rumpler aircraft. Variants of Etrich's design were soon being produced by at least 54 German and Austrian aircraft firms, including Harlan-Flugzeugwerke (modeled here), which produced at least four known variants. \n\nThis aircraft was in that group of \"flying machines\" which were a part of the German Air Force when World War I erupted in August of 1914. Most <i>Tauben</i> featured a single aileron and unique split rudder configuration. Most variants, including this Harlan model were two-seat monoplanes. The <i>Taube</i> modeled here was a <i>Pfeiltaube</i> (Arrow Dove) variant, likely designed during 1912. <i>Pfeiltauben</i> were distinguished by their swept-back wings.\n\nThe Harlan <i>Taube</i> flew unarmed except for sidearms carried by pilots and served primarily in a reconnaissance role. The German Air Force acquired several of these machines in 1913 and they were available at the outbreak of World War I. The precise number of Harlan <i>Taube</i> aircraft deployed by Germany is unknown -probably very few because the initial 1913 acquisition was never augmented. It is known that during the first days of War, Germany flew <i>Tauben</i> during reconnaissance sorties in support of advancing German ground troops. \nThe aircraft proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of combat service and their careers were very short lived. Their frail wood and fabric construction could not hold up to the rough fields and cow pastures from which they operated. Undercarriage damage and mechanical failures were common. By early 1915 the Harlan <i>Taube</i> had disappeared having been replaced by far better, more modern and more robust reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> Most Harlan <i>Tauben</i> displayed the manufacturer's name in large letters on the fuselage.

The increase in engine power improved the Nie.16's performance characteristics over the Nie.11. However, because the two aircraft had the same dimensions, the Nie.16's larger engine created greater wing-loading and, in the even of engine failure, would cause the aircraft to nose over during a crash landing. The Nie.16 retained the same standard armament of the Nie.11 -a single Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing- though some later aircraft utilized the Alkan synchronizing mechanism to allow guns, mounted forward on the fuselage, to fire though the propeller. \n\nThe Nie.16 began replacing the earlier Nie.11 on the Western Front in 1916.

    "history": "The Farman F.40 merged many of the signature design features of the two Farman Brothers, Maurice and Henri. The cockpit placement and sesquiplane wing design were reminiscent of Maurice's earlier M.F.7 and M.F.11 aircraft, while the tail structure resembled Henri's earlier designs. This amalgamation of design features earned the F.40 the nickname, \"Horace.\" \n\nThe F.40 was designed as a replacement for the earlier M.F.11. Like its predecessor, it was a single-engine two-seater with a \"pusher\" propeller located behind the cockpit. However, unlike the biplane M.F.11, the F.40 was a sesquiplane, with a lower wing that was significantly shorter than the upper. The forward fuselage was a metal gondola with a long, thin nacelle holding the pilot in the rear seat and the observer/ gunner in the forward position. The inline engine, duel radiators and fuel tank occupied the aft portion of the gondola just ahead of the pusher propeller. The aft fuselage back to the tail surfaces was a maze of open struts and wire bracing. The wings and tail planes were of wood framing with fabric covering.\n\nThe F.40 entered service as an infantry and artillery spotter with the Aviation Militaire in late 1915. As manufacturing commences, as many as ten aircraft a day were produced in several variants. Variant aircraft differed primarily in engine type, though a float plane version was constructed as well as a variant equipped with searchlights, and one designed to carry Le Prieur rockets for attacking balloons. A number of F.40s were also configured as bombers, but were deemed unsuccessful in that role. The machines suffered from poor engine performance and were defenseless if attacked from behind. By 1916, the bomber variants were restricted to night-time operations, and were soon phased out entirely.",

At a time when virtually all aircraft were built of fabric-covered wood framing, the Junkers D.1 was of all metal construction -built with aluminum tube framing covered by a skin of stressed corrugated duralumin. The metal construction also eliminated the need for bracing wires on the D.1's wings. The clean lines and all-metal airframe afforded the aircraft great speed, strength and durability both in combat and, perhaps more importantly, in the face of the inclement weather conditions often encountered in the field -conditions which lead to the deterioration of wood and canvas. \n\nThe Junkers D.1 -initially designated J.9- was designed and manufactured by Junkers Fleugzeug-Werke, which supplied aircraft to Germany during both World Wars. Though its design began many months before, the D.1's first flight was not until April of 1918. A total of 41 D.1s were built and at least some were delivered to the front, though it is uncertain whether any saw combat before the armistice.\n\nIn the spring of 1919 numbers of Junker D.1s flew combat sorties in support of the Baltic States in their armed struggle against Russian Bolshevik insurgents. Their performance proved to be outstanding. The design and construction concepts of the Junkers D.1 continue to be embraced in the fighter aircraft of today, making the little machine the direct ancestor of the generations of fighters that followed.",

    "history": "In 1917, the Austrian arm of the Albatros Company changed its name to Ph\u00f6nix Flugzeugwerke AG. The firm's senior engineer, Edmund Sparmann, designed the Ph\u00f6nix D.I in an effort to provide the Austro-Hungarian Air Force with an improved fighter. The D.I incorporated several unusual features for a fighter aircraft of the time. These included inward-sloping intra-plane struts on the wings, a 200 hp (149 kW) engine and dual forward-firing machine guns which were completely enclosed in the fuselage. \n\nThe first production machines entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force in February of 1918. Their performance proved adequate but not truly outstanding. Despite a more powerful engine, the aircraft still suffered from a poor power to weight ratio, which contributed to their poor performance characteristics. Nonetheless, the fighter became the favored aircraft for several Austro-Hungarian air aces during 1918. The D.I's production was limited to only 140 machines -120 for the K.u.K. Luftfahrttruppen [the Austrian Air Force] and 20 for the Austrian Navy. \n\nProduction of the Ph\u00f6nix D.I was terminated in mid 1918 in favor of the Ph\u00f6nix D.II and D.IIa. Both aircraft had lighter structures, and substantially improved performance. The The D.IIa was also fitted with a more powerful 230 hp (172 kW) engine. After World War I, Edmund Sparmann developed a series of Ph\u00f6nix fighters for the Swedish Air Force, which would prove even more successful than his World War I Ph\u00f6nix fighters. \n\nThe Air Force and Naval versions of the Ph\u00f6nix D.1 were each painted in distinct ways. The Naval Ph\u00f6nix D.1 (included elsewhere in this collection) incorporated red and white stripes on its wings and tail-the colors of the Austro-Hungarian coat-of-arms. The Air Force version (like the model displayed here) used a camouflage paint scheme of stippled brown on its upper surfaces.",

    "history": "The Sopwith Pup was designed by Sopwith engineer Harry Hawker as a fighter/interceptor with the first prototypes flying in late February, 1916. It closely resembled the 11/2 Strutter aircraft from which it was partly derived. The Sopwith Company had named the aircraft \"Sopwith Scout,\" but an unofficial nickname was quickly given to the new aircraft of \"Pup.\" This affectionately applied nickname stuck, and the machine was forever called \"The Sopwith Pup.\" It remains unclear how this nickname transpired since the \"Pup\" was no smaller than several other fighter aircraft in operation at the time. One story suggests that its crews felt it was the offspring of the 11/2 Strutter.\n\nThe Pup was made of wooden framing throughout, with a doped fabric covering and thin metal sheeting over its forward fuselage and metal engine cowling. Designed as a biplane, its wings were of equal cord and length, but were slightly staggered. Production models were fitted with an 80 hp Le Rh\u00f4ne engine, and a single Vickers gun synchronized to fire through the propeller.\n\nThe Pup began equipping combat fighter units of the Royal Flying Corps on the Western Front in September of 1916. Its performance was outstanding and it remained in active frontline fighter service until the late autumn of 1917. Most Pups were then withdrawn from the Western Front and were returned to England where they were deployed in homeland defense against the German bombers and Zeppelin airships. In an effort to improve their speed and performance in this home-defense role, most Pups underwent an engine change and were given 100 hp Gn\u00f4me Monosoupape engines. Some Pups were also fitted with Le Prieur rockets, which had proven to be superior to machine guns in destroying German Zeppelins. \n\nProduction of the Sopwith Pup continued through the summer of 1918 with a total of 1,770 being manufactured. A number of Pups were deployed by the Royal Naval Air Service aboard the British aircraft carriers <i>Campania</i>, <i>Furious</i> and <i>Manxman</i>. As such, they were among the first aircraft to fly from a warship.",

    "history": "The Friedrichshafen G.III was a large, fixed-wing bomber used to carry out nighttime bombings of Allied cities and military installations. The German aviation firm Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH manufactured a total of 338 of these large machines. Unlike most bombers of the era, both of its engines were \"pusher\" mounted rather than the more common \"tractor\" type. The G.III could also carry a heavier bomb load than most aircraft of the era.\n\nThe G.III was developed as an alternative to the lighter-than-air Zeppelins first used on strategic bombing missions of Allied cities. The Allies responded to the early airship raids by developing night fighters capable of intercepting the slow-moving Zeppelins. The highly flammable airships proved to be easy targets for the fighters and German planners were forced to rethink their approach. Heavy bombers, like the G.III, as well as the Gotha G.V and the Zeppelin Staaken were created to replace the more vulnerable airships. The Friedrichshafen G.III first went into service with three bomber groups of the German Air Force in February of 1917. The G.III achieved considerable success in the nighttime bombing of Allied supply depots at Dunkirk, France, which disrupted Allied efforts on the Western Front. \n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The prototype of the Friedrichshafen G.III modeled here was painted in a stippled dark overall coloration for its role as a night bomber.",

    "history": "The Albatros D.I was introduced in an attempt to wrest air superiority from the Allies' Nieuport 11 and D.H.2 fighters. The design of the D.I continued to refine Albatroswerke's pioneering development of all-wood fuselages. The aircraft exhibited very clean lines, broken only by the boxy radiator protruding above the engine. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque plywood construction, the surface of which was coated with a glossy varnish finish. Its wings and tail surfaces were of wood framing with fabric covering but intra-wing struts and wire bracing were kept to a minimum. The result of these features was a marked reduction in wind resistance. Powered by a large 160 hp engine, the D.I could carry the weight of twin machine guns and was very fast for the time. However, a rather high wing loading detracted from the aircraft's maneuverability. \n\nFollowing trials in August of 1916 the German High Command ordered 50 of the new machines, which began equipping fighter units on the Western Front the following November. Though it is unclear exactly how many D.Is entered service, reports indicate that total numbers on the front declined steadily from the initial delivery in November 1916. The Albatros D.I was almost immediately overtaken by its successor the Albatros D.II, the design and construction of which had begun very shortly after that of the D.I. Indeed, D.II production aircraft were arriving at the front only weeks after the arrival of the D.Is, and the latter aircraft soon appeared in much greater numbers. The two fighters differed only slightly in their external appearance, their performance, their speed and their firepower. However, the D.IIs were preferred by pilots due to the improved visibility afforded by their reduced intra-wing gap. \n\nAlthough manufactured in relatively small numbers, the Albatros D.I was a significant aircraft of World War I, if for no other reason, than it was the first in the lineage of the fine Albatros fighters, which became a mainstay of The German Air Force throughout the War.",

    "title": "Hanriot HD 1",
    "history": "The Hanriot HD 1 machine was the first fighter designed and built by the French aviation firm Avions Hanriot & Co, where Pierre Dupont served as the chief engineer. The small machine first flew in the summer of 1916 and proved to be an agile, maneuverable and excellent fighter. By this time, however, the French Aviation Militaire (the French Air Force) had already committed itself to the mass production of SPAD and Nieuport fighters. The French showed little interest in the Hanriot HD 1 as a result. Italy, however, did adopt the machine. Under license, the Italian firm Societ\u00e0 Nieuport-Macchi supplied 125 HD 1s to the Italian Air force in 1917 and an additional 706 in 1918. The Italian Air Force later adopted the Hanriot HD 1 as its standard fighter aircraft. At the time of its greatest use, the Hanriot HD 1 equipped no less than 16 of 18 Italian fighter units. \n\nBelgium also expressed interest in the Hanriot fighter and acquired 79 of the aircraft from its parent company in France. The machine achieved equal success when it entered service with Belgian forces in August 1917. Belgian airmen even preferred the Hanriot HD 1 to the newer Sopwith Camel. When offered Camels in early 1918, they rejected them in favor of the HD 1s they were already flying. The brilliant Belgian ace Willy Coppens de Houthulst also operated an HD 1. He achieved most of his 37 victories in this machine.\n\nThe Hanriot HD 1 gave an outstanding account of itself during combat. One battle in particular exemplifies the worth of the Hanriot HD 1. At the air battle of Istrana on December 26, 1917, Hanriots of the Italian 6th group shot down 11 German reconnaissance aircraft without loss. Numbers of the Hanriot HD 1s remained in active service long after World War I with the Italian, Belgian and Swiss Air Services-the Swiss having purchased 16 war surplus aircraft following the war. Some HD 1s remained with front line units of these three nations until 1930, a testimony to the excellent performance of this machine.",

    "history": "Aeronautical engineer, John William Dunne experimented heavily in the design of aerodynamically stable aircraft, which would maintain level flight without direct contact with the controls. Many of Dunne's designs took the form of tailless \"flying wings\" like the one modeled here.\n\nOver the years, Dunne developed numerous versions of his flying wing design. His company, the Blair-Atholl Syndicate often licensed its designs to other aircraft firms for production. The aircraft modeled here most closely resembles the Dunne D.8, a variant from 1912 which was produced under license by the Short Brothers and the French firm, Nieuport. While the fuselage layout and long nose-over skid on the model are suggestive of the D.8, the twin propellers and four-wheeled undercarriage more closely resemble its immediate predecessor, the D.5. The experimental and constantly evolving nature of Dunne's designs has lead to many conflicting historical accounts.\n\nThough various militaries took an interest in Dunne's designs, it is unlikely any reached operational service. One D.8 was tested by the Royal Flying Corps in 1914. A few units of a later American-built variant, commonly referred to as the Burgess-Dunne Flying Wings, were delivered to the United States Army Air Service, the United States Navy and the Canadian Aviation Corps. The Canadian aircraft may have even shipped to Europe to participate in the War, but records indicate it was damaged in transit and never used.\n\nIn August of 1913, Commandant Felix flew a D.8 from Eastchurch, England to Villacoublay, France where he made demonstration flights for the French Aeronautics Corps. Felix also over-flew Paris later that month. A production license was issued to the French firm, Nieuport, which exhibited a variant of the D.8 at the Paris Aero Show that year. However, it is unlikely that the French-built Dunne was ever produced for the military. The aircraft modeled here speculates on how a Dunne flying wing might look configured as a bomber.",

    "history": "The A.E.G. C.IV N was developed in 1916 to meet the <i>Idflieg's</i> (the German Air Force High Command) requirement for a <i>nachtflugzeug</i> (night bomber). The <i>Idflieg</i> believed that nighttime missions would be safe from intercept missions given the inherent difficulties of air defense in the darkness of night. The German aviation firm Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts Gesellschaft (A.E.G.) responded to the challenge by modifying an existing reconnaissance aircraft already in its inventory \u2013the A.E.G. C.IV. \n\nThe new night variant retained the general lines and form of the older aircraft but included a number of modifications. To accommodate the weight of a larger bomb-load, the wing span was lengthened by 7 feet 4 inches (2.24 m) and converted to a three-bay intra-wing bracing design. Triangular bracing was also added atop the center of the upper wing and the forward firing machine gun was removed (leaving only a flexible weapon in the rear cockpit). To equip the machine for night time operations, a long exhaust stack was installed to direct exhaust flames above the aircraft thus preserving the pilot\u2019s night vision. The instrument panel was illuminated and navigation lights were installed, along with two powerful, forward-focused landing lights in the leading edge of the upper wing. Many of the machines were also painted in a dark, two-tone night camouflage with suppressed insignia devoid of the usual white border or white field surrounding the black cross. This was done to enhance their nighttime stealth. Satisfactory flight trials of the new machine took place in September of 1916 and the <i>Idflieg</i> immediately issued a production order for the new night raiders. \n\nFrom October of 1917 through August of 1918 one hundred A.E.G C.IV N aircraft were deployed in nighttime bombing attacks by regular daytime bombing units of the German Air Force. The night bombers remained in operational service until the Armistice at the end of the war. In the last months of the War a small number were shifted to German flight schools where they served as two seat trainers. Following the War a few survivors also saw brief civilian use.",

    "history": "The Martinsyde F.4 Buzzard was probably the best and most advanced fighter aircraft built in Great Britain during World War I. Yet, only a small number were manufactured and of these even fewer were deployed in combat. As a result, the Buzzard has been essentially lost in the historical annals of the War. \n\nIn the autumn of 1917 the British Air Ministry issued a specification for a new fighter, which could counter Germany's new Fokker and Albatros machines. The British firm, Martinsyde, Ltd. responded with a new aircraft, the F.4 Buzzard. The aircraft's design paid special attention to aerodynamics. In an effort to reduce wind resistance it was given only a single pair of intra-wing struts, reducing the need for bracing wires. Even the aircraft's two machine guns were enclosed within the engine cowling. They fired through gun tubes which traversed the radiator located immediately behind the propeller. The Buzzard's aerodynamically clean airframe was coupled with a 300 hp (224 kw) Hispano-Suiza engine, one of the most powerful aircraft power-plants then available. The result was a fighter which possessed great speed, great maneuverability and a remarkable rate of climb. \n\nAfter very successful flight trials in the summer of 1918, the British Air Ministry ordered the building of 50 pre-production aircraft. The United States also contracted to build 1,500 for the Army Air Force. But events doomed the Buzzard, Several months before the Buzzard's test flights, the British Air Ministry settled on the Sopwith Snipe as the Royal Flying Corp's new standard fighter aircraft. By the time the Buzzard completed its flight trials, Snipes were pouring off the assembly lines. \n\nSome Buzzards were sent to France in the autumn of 1918 but were largely limited to familiarization training flights. Only the original 50 machines were built for the RAF prior to the end of the War, after which, production was discontinued in favor of the Sopwith Snipe. The huge United States order was also canceled. Following the War, some of the aircraft were purchased by Finland, Spain, Portugal and post-revolutionary Russia.",

Like its land-based counterpart, the new float plane had a skinny, rounded fuselage, which was covered with aluminum -an unusual design choice for the time. These features led the British Breguet Plane Company to nickname them \"tin whistles\". The H-U.2 and its land-based counterpart also utilized an unusual engine. The liquid-cooled radial engine was uncommon at a time when most aircraft had air-cooled rotary power-plants. A pair of radiators protruded above either side of the forward fuselage to cool the engine during flight.\n\nThe aircraft's designer, Louis Breguet was one of the most prominent French aviators and aircraft designers in the decade leading up to World War I. The Paris-based company, which he founded, built a number of flying machines which saw service with both the Aviation Militaire (the French Air Force) and the French Navy during World War I.

    "history": "With a wingspan of nearly 60 feet (18.3m), the Breguet BR.5 was exceptionally large for a single engine machine of the era. Louis Breguet and his company SA des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Berguet began design of an aircraft in late 1914 with the specific purpose of providing France with a bomber which could strike Essen and other German cities where war materials were being manufactured.\n\nAs bomber casualties began to rise with the appearance of armed German fighters over the front, Breguet decided to mount cannons on some of his bombers for use as escort fighters. The escort version was designated the BR.5 and could equip either a bomb load or a 37 mm (1.46 inch) Hotchkiss cannon in the forward cockpit. The BR.5s, however, were not successful in stemming the loss of French Bombers.\n\nThe BR.5 had a gondola-like fuselage with a bombardier/gunner in the forward cockpit with the pilot's cockpit behind. Its engine, completely encased in a metal housing, drove a pusher propeller located at the gondola's rear. The rest of the fuselage was of open-strut construction with a maze of bracing wires. Varnished plywood veneer covered the gondola while fabric covered its wings and tail surfaces. The machine included a number of unique features for an aircraft of the time. It had a narrow box-like bomb bay mounted under each lower wing root just outboard of the fuselage. Each bay carried up to 20 fifteen pound bombs. The aircraft also had two cylindrical gravity-feeding fuel tanks suspended beneath its upper wing. Its tricycle landing gear, gave the machine a level horizontal stance when resting on the ground and during takeoff and landing. \n\nAfter trials in October of 1915 the aircraft was placed into production with the first machines reaching units of the Aviation Militaire in early 1916. From the beginning the aircraft exhibited two serious design problems: its engine was underpowered for the size and weight of the machine, hindering maneuverability, and the pilot had terrible visibility. This led to multiple accidents during takeoff and landing. Worse, it impeded the pilot's ability to see attacking enemy fighters thus denying him the opportunity to take what little evasive action his sluggish machine might allow. \n\nAfter mounting combat losses and an exceptionally disastrous raid on Oberndorf, Germany in October of 1916, all BR.5 aircraft were withdrawn from daytime operations and shifted to nighttime sorties where enemy interception was less of a problem. But the lack of pilot visibility led to numerous crashes during night time landings. Casualities became unacceptable.

Its construction incorporated a wood frame, wire bracing and fabric covering, common among WWI aircraft. Many other companies in addition to Sopwith manufactured the Camel for both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Navy Air Service. These companies included Boulton Paul; British Caudron; Clayton and Shuttleworth; Hooper; March, Jones and Cribb; Nieuport and General; Portholme Aerodrome; and Ruston and Proctor. Deliveries of the aircraft commenced in May 1917. Eventually, 5,490 were delivered. \n\nThe Camel acquired its distinct name from the hump over the forward fuselage area. This area protected the craft's two machine guns from intense cold that could freeze the ammunition belts and jam the guns. When flown, the Camel incurred a huge amount of torque from its rotary engine and, consequently, could be difficult to fly. The number of fatalities during training on this aircraft equaled its combat fatalities. Experienced pilots, however, achieved great results with this fighter. Late in the War, the Sopwith Snipe replaced most of the Camels.",

    "history": "The Fokker D.VII began arriving on the Western Front at the end of March, 1918. The immediate successor of the famous Fokker Dr.I triplane, the D.VII shared many characteristics of its predecessor. Both aircraft exhibited the same basic construction of wooden cantilever wings without bracing wires and a welded steel fuselage. The D.VII also retained the unique \"one-piece\" lower wing which slid through a cutout in the lower longerons allowing the wing's frame to pass all the way through the fuselage. The most obvious difference between the D.VII and its predecessor is that the Dr.I had three wings to the D.VII's two. The intra-wing struts also show some variation between the two aircraft.\n\nPrior to the end of the War in November of 1918, some 775 machines reached 30 German fighter units. More than 3000 Fokker D VIIs were produced during the aircraft's entire production run both during and after World War I. The D.VII proved so formidable in combat that, after the War, the Treaty of Versailles specified that all of Germany's Fokker D.VII's be surrendered to the Allied Air Forces. The United States military sent many of these aircraft to the United States for analysis and they continued to fly in the United States throughout the 1920s. Builder Anthony Fokker continued to build and sell them in Holland after the conclusion of the war and more that 3000 were built during and after the war. \n\nThis model of the Fokker D.VII replicates the aircraft flown by German World War I ace, Bruno Loerzer who scored 44 victories in combat over the Western Front.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> The aircraft of Bruno Loerzer upon which this model is based was painted in an unusual pattern of black and white stripes -certainly not a camouflage scheme by any stretch of the imagination.",

    "history": "The Lebed XII and its immediate predecessor, the Lebed XI, were designed by Vladimir A. Lebedev, founder of the Russian firm Aktzionernoe Obshchestvo Vozdukhoplavania V.A. Lebedeva (V.A. Lebedev Joint-Stock Aeronautics Company). Both aircraft were largely based on a captured German Albatros B.II. Russian officials felt that it was more efficient to replicate proven designs than to develop all new aircraft.\n\nThe Lebed XII was a single-engine, two-seat biplane constructed of a plywood-covered wooden frame. While this construction method resulted in a very strong structure, it added considerable weight to the airframe. The aircraft utilized a French Salmson liquid-cooled radial engine- a very unique power plant. The Salmson was the only radial liquid-cooled engine used during the War. Liquid cooling of a radial engine was soon abandoned in favor of air cooling since experience revealed that coolant added weight to the radiator and imposed a needless drag on performance. \n\nAfter successful test flights in January of 1916, the Central Military Technical Board placed an order for 225 machines, which began replacing the Voisin as the standard corps aircraft. Unfortunately, operational Lebed XIIs proved problematic. The exhaust pipes were situated in such a way that the exhaust threatened to asphyxiate the observer in the rear cockpit. Furthermore, the pilots reported that it was difficult to pull out of a dive, and the aircraft was also prone to catch fire while in flight. Nevertheless, the Lebed XII was considered superior to the Voisins it was designed to replace.\n\nRecords indicate that Lebed XIIs were still active with the Imperial Russian Air Force at the time of the Russian Revolution and the country's withdrawal from World War I. Following the Revolution, a few remained flying for the Bolshevik controlled \"Red Air Force\" and some even participated in the 1919 Russian Civil War between White and Red Russian factions.",

    "history": "The Sopwith Snipe was the last in Sopwith's lineage of fighters to see combat in World War I. Originally designated the Sopwith 7.F.1, the machine acquired the nickname \"Snipe\" which stuck and was subsequently officially adopted. Sopwith's senior engineer, Herbert Smith, designed the Snipe, which was intended to replace his earlier design, the ubiquitous ubiquitous Sopwith Camel. The Snipe was built around the powerful new 230 hp (171.5 kW) Bentley B.R.2 rotary engine. Its external appearance was very similar to the Camel; Both aircraft shared the same rounded fuselage, the same raised hump in front of the cockpit, which housed two machine guns, the same two-bay wing bracing (though the Snipe had a slightly longer wing span), and the same tail plane. \n\nAfter very successful flight trials in the autumn of 1917, the British Air Ministry designated the Snipe as Great Britain's new standard fighter and ordered it into mass production. In face of the urgent need for the new machine, manufacture of the Snipe was also licensed to Boulton & Paul, Coventry Ordnance Works, Napier and Ruston, Proctor in England, and Nieuport in France. The first production aircraft began equipping operational fighter units of the Royal Air Force on the Western Front in the early summer of 1918. Although the Snipe did not possess exceptional speed, it was highly maneuverable and had a very high rate of climb. Further, it was sturdy and capable of withstanding a great deal of punishment. Many authorities, then and now, regard the Snipe as the best Allied fighter in combat service at the end of World War I. \n\nIn April of 1918, the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Flying Service. The new combined service was renamed the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Snipe remained its principle fighter. Production continued into the early 1920s with over 1,100 built and the Snipe remained in service until 1926. This model replicates a \"factory fresh\" Snipe flown on the Western Front during the last days of World War I by Victoria Cross recipient Major W.G. Barker.",

    "history": "When World War I broke out in August of 1914, Bavaria (the southern region of Germany) had its own air force. Although a part of the overall German air service, the Royal Bavarian Flying Corps had a surprising degree of autonomy. Bavaria also had its own aircraft manufacturing industry, which included the Munich-based company, Flugmaschinen-Werke Gustav Otto. \n\nIn early 1913 the firm designed the biplane modeled here. In addition to marketing the new machine to wealthy sportsmen desiring to fly, Otto also sold several to the Royal Bavarian Flying Corps, which designated the aircraft the Otto B. With the onset of war, Bavaria deployed the aircraft on reconnaissance sorties in support of ground forces. \n\nThe aircraft's construction was typical for the era -wood framing throughout with doped fabric covering its wings and tail surfaces and varnished plywood veneer covering its fuselage nacelle. An open strut framework supported the Type B's tail structures. The aircraft was configured as a \"pusher\", with its engine and propeller mounted on a steel framework at the rear of the fuselage. This was a design feature favored by Otto at a time when most other German firms considered pusher aircraft to be old fashioned. \n\nUnarmed, Otto's biplanes were confined largely to reconnaissance duties and artillery spotting, though some records suggest a few participated in at least one night raid on Dunkirk. The Type B's service period was brief. As the War progressed it became abundantly clear that the open-framed pusher aircraft, such as this one, were hopelessly obsolete. \n\nBy early 1916 Otto Bs were no longer listed on Bavarian Flying Corps manifests. It is presumed that by that time they had all been struck from service. When Germany retired older combat aircraft from active service it often sent them to its ally, Bulgaria. Otto Type Bs may well have been among these, but, there is inadequate historical evidence to definitively confirm this.\n\n<b>Model Builder's Comments:</b> This model depicts an aircraft equipped with an Argus engine.

    "history": "The Sopwith Triplane initiated an intense but brief vogue in fighter aircraft. Though its three-wing design was radical for the time, its fuselage had been derived from the craft's immediate predecessor, the Sopwith Pup. Both aircrcraft were designed by Herbert Smith, chief engineer of the Sopwith Aviation Company. By adding a third wing to his design, Smith increased the aircraft's lift and gave it greater maneuverability and a higher rate of climb.\n\nThe new triplane first flew in May of 1916. After successful pre-production test flights, 400 machines were immediately ordered. The British Royal Flying Corps, however, favored other fighter types and displayed little interest in the triplane. As a result, only pilots of the Royal Navy flew the Sopwith Triplane. With its allocation to only this single service, its total production was limited to just 144 machines. \n\nThe Sopwith Triplane began operations in February of 1917. It achieved great initial success on the Western Front and briefly shifted air superiority to the Allies. Canadian ace Raymond Collishaw, among others, flew the Sopwith Triplane. In May and June of 1917, Collishaw shot down seven enemy aircraft and damaged another seventeen in this machine. \n\nTo compete with this new British fighter, no less than fourteen different German aircraft manufacturers designed and built triplane prototypes. Of these, the Fokker Dr.I performed best in competitive flight trials and became the direct German response to the Sopwith Triplane. The Fokker Dr.I achieved fame through the exploits of German's Baron Manfred von Richthofen, the highest scoring ace of World War I. He flew a Fokker Dr.I during the last months of his life. \n\nAlthough their careers were brilliant, the triplanes of both sides were built in relatively small numbers and served in active combat for only a brief period. As early as the summer of 1917, Sopwith Camels succeeded the British triplanes. The German triplanes were also replaced by better and more modern Albatros and Fokker fighters.\n\nThis particular model exemplifies the Sopwith Triplane flown by Lt. C.D. Booker of the Royal Navy between April and August of 1917. He achieved 17 air victories during this time.",

Rather than resort to the common solution of configuring the machine in a pusher configuration, the SA.1 and SA.2 instead placed the gunner's position in a nacelle mounted in front of the propeller.\n\nIt is not surprising that this unique configuration was not popular with the men who flew the aircraft. Evaluations indicated that the aircraft's engine suffered from inadequate cooling and that the gunnery nacelle suffered from excessive vibration. Pilots also complained that their field of view was obstructed by the forward nacelle, and the gunners feared they would be crushed by the engine in the event of a crash.\n\nDespite its failings, nearly 100 SPAD SA.2s were built with some 57 being sent to the Imperial Russian Air Force (such as the machine modeled here). The remainder went to the Aviation Militarie. SA.2s had a brief career and by mid 1916 they were being replaced by improved machines.

The German aircraft manufacturing firm Rumpler-Werke A.G. responded with a single-seat seaplane designated the 6BI (modeled here). \n\nThe 6BI utilized the same airframe as the land-based Rumpler C.I modified with floats. Its construction was typical for the time -wood framing with a doped fabric covering except for metal sheet surrounding the forward fuselage. The 6BI was powered by a 160 hp Mercedes DIII engine equipped with a distinctive \"rhino horn\" exhaust stack. The aircraft was armed, though sources are unclear as to whether the standard armament was one or two guns.\n\nThe first prototype 6BI flew in the late summer of 1916 and was deemed adequate for production. By the end of the year, production aircraft began equipping units of the German Naval Air Service at seaplane bases along the Baltic and North Sea coasts. Further modification of the Rumpler seaplane resulted in the 6BII, which looked similar to the 6BI save for a slightly longer wing span and a different horizontal tail. \nFifty of the 6BII variants were delivered between May 1917 and January 1918 when Rumpler discontinued all 6B manufacture. \n\nBy 1918 Germany had handed off most of its Rumpler 6B seaplane fighters to its ally Turkey where they served in the Black Sea Theater.

The Ca.42 represents one of the largest aircraft of the Great War, second in wingspan to only three other machines: two massive Soviet Sikorsky bombers and the even larger Zeppelin Staaken R.VI German heavy bomber. \n\nThe Ca.42 featured a separate bomb bay compartment attached to the lower wing of the craft. This compartment was mounted directly beneath the gondola-like central fuselage containing the pilot, a nose gunner and a third \"pusher\" engine. To support its long, thin wings, the machine required a maze of struts and bracing wires. Despite these structures, the aircraft's wings drooped when taking-off, landing and sitting on the ground. Skids placed beneath the tips of the lower wings prevented damage should the wing tips hit the ground. During flight, the lift of the wings reversed this drooping and the wings took on a slight upward or \"dihedral\" angle. \n\nThe Ca.42 primarily carried out bombing raids on the larger cities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I. These missions often required clear weather, as this enabled the crew to visually navigate through the peaks of the Alps; these peaks rose higher than the Ca.42's operational ceiling of just over 9,800 feet (3,000 m). Ca.42s also carried out a few night bombing missions, but did not fly over the Alps for these missions. Ca.42s also saw action in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto and six of the aircraft were loaned to the British Royal Naval Air Service for use as maritime reconnaissance aircraft. \n\nOverall, the Ca.42s performed well, but they were complex, time-consuming and expensive to construct. Only 23 were produced before the war's end, and none were manufactured afterward. Italian aeronautical designers, however, continued to favor its three-engine design until after World War II.",

    "history": "During World War I there were more different types of reconnaissance aircraft designed and placed into service than fighter and bomber types combined. Although fighters and bombers captured the imagination of the public, their impact on the outcome of the War has been questioned by some historians. On the other hand, the information provided to military leaders by reconnaissance aircraft had a significant impact on many major battles. Knowing the numbers, position and movement of enemy troops and supplies proved vital to the successful outcome of some land battles. It is not, therefore, surprising that the generals of both sides kept constant pressure on their respective aviation industries to provide new and better reconnaissance aircraft. \n\nOne of the earliest reconnaissance types to enter service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force was the Lohner C.I, modeled here. It was designed by the pioneer Austrian aeronautical engineer, Jacob Lohner, the founder and owner of a firm which was famous for building naval flying boats. The Lohner C.I's construction was of wood framing throughout with a varnished wood veneer covering the fuselage. Its wings and tail structures were covered with a doped fabric. Painted aluminum sheeting completely enclosed the engine and the top of the forward fuselage and the radiator was mounted in front of the upper wing. \n\nThe Lohner C.I first flew in late 1915 and production aircraft began equipping combat units on the Western, Italian, Balkan and Eastern Fronts in the first weeks of 1916. The machine proved sluggish in flight. It lacked agility and had a poor rate of climb, which made it easy prey for the machineguns of Allied fighters. The C.I fared better on the Balkan Front where there was less fighter opposition. On the Western Front, even when accompanied by a fighter escort, its losses became prohibitive. After barely a year in service Lohner C.I aircraft were withdrawn from active reconnaissance roles and were replaced by better performing machines, primarily the much superior Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. The Lohner C.I aircraft were relegated to Austro-Hungarian flight schools where they were employed as two-seat trainers.",

The use of aluminum gave the aircraft great strength and was advanced for a time when aircraft of wood and cloth construction were more common. \n\nPrototypes for two variants, the Bre.14 A2 armed reconnaissance version and the Bre.14 B2 light bomber (modeled here), flew for the first time in November, 1916 and entered service with the Aviation Militaire on the Western Front early in the summer of 1917. The machines proved to be fast and maneuverable with a good rate of climb. Breguet produced 5,500 of both variants during the war and an additional 2,500 before 1926. The United States purchased 376 Bre.14 B2 aircraft for service in the last year of the war on the Western Front. Although they could carry only a small bomb load, this aircraft was among the more successful light bombers during World War I.",

    "history": "First constructed in 1913, the Roland Arrow biplane included a very unusual feature in early aircraft design -swept back wings. At the time, the wings of most aircraft were fitted perpendicular to the aircraft's fuselage. Only a few rare models, often referred to as <i>Pfeilen</i> (arrows) featured swept wings. In fact, swept wings would not become the norm until the advent of jet-powered aircraft in the 1950s. \n\nThe Roland Arrow was constructed by the Berlin-based manufacturing firm, Luftfahrzeug Gesellschaft (L.F.G.), which used the trade name, \"Roland\" to avoid confusion with another German firm, L.V.G. Aside from the unconventional wing configuration, L.F.G. utilized typical materials and construction methods when creating the Arrow. The aircraft was a two-seater consisting of a wood-framed fuselage covered in doped fabric and powered by a 100 h.p. Mercedes or Argus engine.\n\nLike most pre-World War I aircraft, the Roland Arrow had been built for the civilian market. However, the type was counted among the aircraft in the German Air Service's inventory when World War I broke out in August of 1914. Like most of the earliest aircraft adopted for military use, the Roland Arrow was likely employed as a reconnaissance platform.\n\nRecords are silent as to the operational achievements of the Arrow biplane during World War I. Just before the War, however, a specially fitted Roland Arrow piloted by Bruno Langer made a non-stop flight of 16 hours duration. While the aircraft possessed excellent qualities for a pre-war design, its slow speed and lack of armament must surely have made military use untenable by 1915 when armed Allied fighters appeared in the skies over the Western Front.",

    "history": "The Curtiss line of flying boats was one of only two American built aircraft-types to play a significant role in World War I -The other being the Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\" trainer. The predecessor of the H-16 flying boat was developed in 1914 at the request of Rodman Wanamaker, who was planning to attempt a transatlantic flight. The order for the aircraft, originally named America was cancelled at the outbreak of World War I. However, in 1916, the U.S. Navy ordered a number of flying boats based on the design. The new aircraft were designated H-12s and were the immediate predecessor of the H-16 modeled here.\n\nThe Curtiss flying-boats set many of the standards which would be used in flying-boat aircraft throughout the decades to come. The aircraft featured a v-shaped hull, which diverted water away from the cockpit during takeoff and landing and greatly reduced the drag on the underside of the aircraft while on the water. The H-12 and H-16 were twin-engine biplanes, which utilized a \"tractor\" configuration with forward-facing propellers. This differed from many flying boats of the time, which were configured as \"pushers\".\n\nThe United States Navy initially ordered 19 production H-12s and the British Royal Naval Air Service (R.N.A.S.) ordered an additional 50. In Britain, the aircraft were referred to as \"Large Americas\" to distinguish them from the smaller Curtiss H.4 flying boats -called \"Small Americas\"- already in R.N.A.S. service. \n\nThe H-12 proved highly successful as a maritime patrol aircraft. In May of 1917, British H-12s successfully downed a Zeppelin, damaged another and sunk a German U-boat. Similar success stories continued throughout the year and prompted the development of a larger, improved version of the H-12, which became the H-16.\n\nThe first H-16s began appearing in the spring of 1918, but production delays meant that only 15 reached operational service before the Armistice. Nevertheless, The United States Navy eventually acquired 274 Curtiss H-16s, some of which remained in service until 1928.",

First flying in 1912, the machine was a shoulder-wing monoplane, built with wood framing covered by doped fabric. Metal sheeting surrounded the engine and forward fuselage. The Deperdussin Type TT employed wing warping for lateral control, which required extensive wire bracing and control cables on the upper and lower wing surfaces.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in August of 1914, the Aviation Militaire (French Air Force) had 138 airworthy aircraft in its inventory. Among this mixed bag of \"flying machines\" were two escadrilles equipped with Deperdussin Type TT aircraft such as the one modeled here. Most of France's 138 aircraft had originally been intended for sale on the civilian market, but were acquired and modified by the Aviation Militaire for use as reconnaissance platforms in support of French Army ground forces. French military leaders, like the leaders of all the combatant nations of the War, were initially skeptical about the usefulness of aircraft as weapons. Their potential as reconnaissance platforms was, however, universally recognized and early World War I aircraft were used solely in this capacity. \n\nDeperdussin Type TT aircraft proved frail and unsuited to the rigors and stresses intrinsic to wartime conditions. The slow, poorly maneuverable and unarmed machines often did not survive operational sorties once German and Austro-Hungarian fighter aircraft arrived over the Western Front in mid 1915. In an effort to give the Deperdussin Type TT some armament, a machine gun was mounted on a stand atop the forward fuselage with the gun firing over the propeller arc. This experimental arrangement proved unstable and the gun was impossible to reload. The concept was abandoned. Unacceptable losses coupled with the availability of more modern and armed reconnaissance machines allowed the Aviation Militaire to withdraw all of its Deperdussin Type TT aircraft by the end of 1915. The machine is, however, historically significant as one of the first aircraft to be deployed in military service.",

    "history": "The Brandenburg D.I was designed by the German aeronautical engineer, Ernst Heinkel, who would later go on to head the famous aviation firm bearing his name. Although designed in Germany, all production of the D.I was carried out in Austria by two separate Austrian firms,  Phonix-Flugzeug-Werke AG and Ungarische Flugzeugfabrik AG. Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were allies during World War I, so this convergence of effort between the two countries is not totally surprising. However, historical records are unclear as to why the design and manufacture of this aircraft took place in different countries. \n\nDeployed exclusively by the Austro-Hungarians, the D.I was of conventional construction for a fighter of its time -wood framing throughout, with fabric covering of its wings and tail surfaces and a fuselage covered with a varnished plywood veneer. A thin metal alloy covered the forward fuselage around the engine. However, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I was unique in one aspect of its design; instead of the usual arrangement of vertical intra-wing struts and bracing wires, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I utilized a complicated single intra-wing \"strut complex\". The eight half struts comprising this single strut complex were joined into triangles at a central point between its wings. These triangles created the aircraft's entire intra-wing support. There were no bracing wires. The intent of this design was to eliminate the aerodynamic drag created by multiple struts and wires. \n\nThe new machine first flew in the summer of 1916 and entered service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force the following autumn. From the start, the aircraft was sluggish, relatively slow, marginally maneuverable and unstable in flight. Further, its deep fuselage provided the pilot with limited visibility. Worse, it was plagued by a series of accidents which earned it the nickname, \"the flying coffin\". Despite these shortcomings, 122 D.Is were produced and they labored on in active combat service with the Austro-Hungarian Air Force until mounting losses forced their retirement in late 1917.",

    "history": "In 1912 the pioneering French aeronautical engineer, Louis Br\u00e9guet, began designing the A-G.4 -an aircraft specifically intended to serve France as a military reconnaissance platform. Br\u00e9guet's new machine included three very unique features: a machine gun positioned in the rear cockpit, which could be manually operated by an observer; protective steel armor plating around the cockpit and a four-wheeled undercarriage, which gave the machine a level horizontal stance when sitting on the ground. \n\nThe A-G.4 first flew in the summer of 1913 and began equipping units of the Aviation Militaire the following autumn, where it saw immediate service over the Western Front upon the outbreak of hostilities. At the beginning of World War I, the A-G.4 was the only aircraft in the French inventory which was not originally built for sale on the pre-war civilian market. French military leaders of the time had little confidence in the value of \"flying machines\" as weapons of war. They did, however, recognize their potential in the area of reconnaissance and acquired several available civilian aircraft types which they modified for use in battlefield reconnaissance.\n\nThe Br\u00e9guet A-G.4 had a brief career. The machine gun and its ammunition coupled with the armor plating made the machine seriously over weight. This, in turn, adversely impacted its operational ceiling, speed and maneuverability. When faster and more agile German and Austro-Hungarian fighters armed with machine guns began appearing over the Western Front in the autumn of 1915, unacceptable losses forced the withdrawal of the A-G.4 in favor of faster and more capable reconnaissance aircraft. A few A-G.4s labored on as trainers after their retirement from front line service, their machine guns and armor plating having been removed. Although its operational contribution to the Allied War effort was marginal due to its brevity, the Br\u00e9guet A-G.4 is historically noteworthy as the first aircraft to see action during wartime while being both armed with a machine gun and protected by armor plating.",

This firm acquired the rights to build aircraft from the French company, Morane-Saulnier and later from the firm LFG Roland. With the experience gleaned from these early efforts, Pfalz Flugzeugwerke began to design and manufacture its own fighter aircraft after the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThe Pfalz D.XII, modeled here, improved upon its immediate predecessor, the D.III. Like its predecessor, the new D.XII was also a biplane. It possessed all wood construction with a thin plywood veneer over its fuselage. The D.XII's wings, tail surfaces and all of its control surfaces were fabric covered. Because of its sturdy construction, the D.XII could dive faster and steeper than most all of its contemporaries. After competitive trials with other new fighter designs in mid 1918, the German military contracted for 500 D.XIIs to be built. \n\nThe D.XII did have a drawback. It was not able to make a tight turn in flight and was far more sluggish in combat than the other new German fighter to arrive in mid 1918-the Fokker D.VII. The poor control response made the new Pfalz D.XIIs unpopular with German fighter pilots, who preferred the new Fokker D.VIIs. \n\nNotwithstanding their shortcomings, by the end of the War nearly 800 Pfalz D.XIIs had been built and placed into front-line service on the Western Front.  Following World War I, numbers of these Pfalz D.XIIs were taken in hand by the victorious Allied air services. After evaluation, they deemed these aircraft to be inferior to other German fighters and the most modern Allied fighters. Four Pfalz D.XII aircraft have survived into the 21st Century and are on display in air museums in the United States, Australia and France.",

    "history": "The Fokker Dr.I ('Dr.' standing for <i>Dreidecker</i>-or triplane) is perhaps the most famous aircraft of World War I.  Inspired by the success of the the British Sopwith Triplane, German military leaders commissioned several aviation firms to construct a comparable triplane aircraft. The Dr.I represents Fokker Flugzeug-Werke's response to this call. The Fokker Dr.I went into production and entered service in the skies of the Western Front in late 1917. The design proved very successful, achieving 21 victories during its first three weeks of operation. Some speculate that a number of these early victories occurred when allied pilots and gunners confused the new Dr.I for a British Sopwith Triplane, which it closely resembled. By the time the Dr.I was recognized as an enemy German fighter, it was too late.\n\nThe Fokker Dr.I Triplane's fame doubtless comes from its association with World War I's leading air ace, Baron Manfred von Richthofen -better known as the \"Red Baron\". Although he achieved the majority of his eighty air victories while flying in Albatros D. IIs, IIIs and Vs, it was while flying the Fokker Dr.I, during the last months of his career, that he garnered his greatest fame.\n\nThe Baron commanded Jagdstaffel 1, Germany's best and most feared fighter unit. Because the unit painted their aircraft in a variety of bright colors, it become known as the 'Flying Circus\". Von Richthofen earned the nickname \"Red Baron\" from his Fokker Dr.I, which was painted a vivid red. While flying this red Fokker Dr.I (Nr. 425/17), he was shot down and killed over Sailly-le-Sec in the Somme Valley of France on the morning of April 21, 1918. It remains unclear whether he was killed by a bullet from an opposing Allied fighter aircraft with which he was engaged or by fire from Australian ground forces known to have been shooting at his low flying Dr.I. \n\nDespite its operational success, the Dr.I was plagued by structural problems throughout its career; problems which modifications in construction and retrofitting of existing machines did not totally correct.\n\nApproximately 320 Dr.I's were built, far less than several other German fighter types. The \"heyday\" of the Dr.I was short - perhaps from February to June 1918 and the machine's overall impact on the air war over the Western Front was minimal. In the end, Dr.Is were replaced in German fighter units by the far superior Fokker D.VII aircraft. Nonetheless, the fame of the Fokker Dr.I lives on in the imagination of the public.",

    "history": "Just four months after the outbreak of World War I, German aircraft manufacturer, Siemens-Schuckert (SSW) began construction on a series of seven highly unusual three-engine bombers designed by Bruno and Franz Steffen. The biplane aircraft incorporated an unconventional \"forked\" tail configuration designed to allow a clear field of fire to the rear. The planes were driven by two propellers mounted between the wings and powered by a series of three engines mounted in the fuselage. The machines also featured an enclosed cabin -another unusual feature for the time- giving the nose a distinctly bus-like appearance.\n\nThe first in the series, designated R.I (modeled here), took its maiden flight on May 24, 1915 and, after testing, arrived on the Eastern Front by October of that year. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent that the R.I was unfit for frontline service, and the machine was re-assigned as a trainer for future R-type crews. The following six versions of the aircraft, designated R.II-VII, featured improved engines and a redesigned forward fuselage. These aircraft also required modification after delivery before they were fit for combat. Like their predecessor, R.II and III were relegated to training duties but RIV-VII saw active duty on the Eastern Front with Riesenflugzeug-Abteilung 501 (Giant Aircraft Division 501), where they conducted bombing raids against Russian military and industrial targets.\n\nIn August of 1917, Rfa 501 was reassigned to the Western Front and re-equipped with the larger Zeppelin Staaken heavy bomber.

Designer, Gustav Delage radically departed from the wing design of earlier Nieuport fighters when he designed the 28 C1. He abandoned his unique sesquiplane lower wing used in previous models in favor of standard biplane wings. He did, however, retain the narrow chord and single spar from his earlier wing designs. Unfortunately, a poor upper wing design caused structural failures and fabric separations at high speed -a process called \"losing the laundry.\" Engine fires were also a regular occurrence and some pilots lost confidence in the aircraft because of these problems. \n\nThe United States purchased 298 Nieuport 28s for service in the United States Air Service. American ace Eddie Rickenbacker and James Norman Hall, author of <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>, flew this aircraft over the Western Front during the 28 C1's short career in the last months of the War. By the summer of 1918, the SPAD XIII C1 replaced most of these aircraft, but some Nieuport 28s continued to fly until the end of the war. \n\nWhen World War I concluded, many Nieuport 28s returned to the United States. The United States Navy employed twelve of the aircraft on early battleships in experimental flights off improvised platforms. The Museum of Flight example is thought to be one of these Navy models.",

    "history": "While the Imperial Russian Air Service began World War I with more aircraft than France or Germany, many of the machines were imported models already considered obsolete by the other nations. Furthermore, The Russian aviation industry was underdeveloped compared to those of the War's other major combatant nations. Recognizing the situation as a business opportunity, Russian banker, Artur Antonovich Anatra founded the Anatra Aircraft Company in Odessa. It was this firm that designed and produced the Anatra DS modeled here. \n\nThe Anatra DS developed from the earlier Anatra D and appeared very similar to its predecessor. The primary difference between the DS and the earlier aircraft was the inclusion of a 150 hp liquid-cooled Salmson radial engine. The inclusion of this engine led to the plane's nickname, \"<i>Anasal</i>\" -a combination of \"Anatra\" and \"Salmson\". The radial engine was unique at a time when virtually all aircraft had either rotary air-cooled engines or inline liquid-cooled engines. Aside from this, the <i>Anasal</i> was of standard construction for the era -wood framing, plywood veneer over the fuselage, metal sheeting about its engine and fabric covering of its wings and tail surfaces. \n\nApproximately 70 production <i>Anasal</i>s were built and delivered to the Imperial Russian Air Force before the end of hostilities. Little is recorded about the operational history of these machines but it is known that at the time of the Russian Revolution and the overthrow of the Imperial government that Anatra DS aircraft were listed on the rosters of the Imperial Russian Air Force. \n\nWhile the chaotic events of the Russian Civil War, which began in 1917 are still being sorted out by historians, it is thought that some of these aircraft remained operational with both the \"White\" and \"Red\" air forces.

The D.V featured a semi-monocoque wooden fuselage with wings built of a wood frame and doped fabric covering. Though it looked similar to the Albatros D.II and D.III, the D.V had a strengthened wing structure and an improved Mercedes D.IIIa engine. Despite its reinforced wing, the machine still suffered from wing failure during steep dives. This resulted in several fatal accidents and needless combat losses. Investigations eventually found that the wing spar was placed too far aft, resulting in excessive vibration and eventual breakage during prolonged dives. In a continuing effort to address this problem, Albatros-Werke added a supplemental strut to later model D.Vs.\n\nThe D.V entered combat service on the Western Front in May of 1917. Operations of the Albatros D.V reached a peak in May of 1918 when 1,059 machines were in active service with 37 German Jasta. At that time, the D.V and a variant, the D.Va, constituted 48% of all German fighters deployed with combat units. After May of 1918, the Albatros machines were gradually replaced by Fokker D.VII fighter aircraft. \n\nThe Albatros D.V modeled here was flown on the Western Front by Vizefeldwebel (Staff Sergeant) Barth, a member of Jasta 10, in the late autumn of 1917.",

Albatros's aircraft distinguished themselves and were widely deployed during the entirety of the conflict. The C.I, which was designed by famous German aeronautical engineer Ernst Heinkel, utilized conventional wood & fabric construction with thin sheet metal surrounding the engine and forward fuselage. \n\nThe C.I entered service with Germany in early 1915, but despite its success, was replaced by the improved Albatros C.III beginning in early 1916. Rather than retire the design, Germany then began supplying its C.Is to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans Empire, which had controlled the Middle East for generations, was disintegrating. The Turks desperately needed aircraft with which to patrol the vast desert areas of the empire and to conduct aerial attacks against a British-supported Arab insurrection. The Germans shipped numbers of their redundant Albatros C. I aircraft to Turkey in order to ensure that the Ottoman Empire remained an effective ally. \n\nThe Turkish C.Is required modification to function in the desert environment. The aircraft's radiators were enlarged to allow for greater heat exchange and metal shutters were fitted over the radiators to keep out desert sand. The usual single forward firing machine gun was augmented with a second weapon and a light bomb load was provided for ground attack. Modified C.Is remained in service with the Turkish Air Force throughout the Middle East theater until the War's end.

    "history": "The design of the German Pfalz E.I fighter was largely based on the French Morane-Saulnier type L. In early 1914, before the outbreak of World War I, the German aviation company Pfalz Flugzeug-Werke began building the French-designed Morane-Saulnier type L monoplane under license. With the onset of war, Pfalz took the experience gleaned from building the type L and designed and built its own aircraft, the Pfalz E.I (modeled here). The Pfalz E.I retained many of the features of its French predecessor including its shoulder-wing monoplane design, wooden frame, fabric covering, metal engine cowling, and its single machine gun.\n\nDerived from a similar French fighter, the Pfalz E.I signified an important advance in aviation technology in its own right.\n\nThe Pfalz E.I represents one of the first aircraft to include a propeller-synchronized machine gun system. A synchronized rod allowed the aircraft's machine gun to fire only when its propeller was not in the gun's line of fire. This represented a significant improvement over the Morane-Saulnier type L, which utilized steel plates fixed to its propeller to deflect any bullets which might strike it. \n\nThe Pfalz E.I first joined German Air Force units on the Western Front in October 1916 where it primarily served as an escort fighter for German reconnaissance aircraft flying over the Allied lines. The Pfalz E.I also served in the German and Ottoman Air Forces in 1916 during the Sinai desert campaigns in the Middle East. The Bavarian Air Force employed several of these fighters as unarmed reconnaissance aircraft as well. The E.I performed marginally compared to other German fighters of the era and a maximum of only 27 remained in service with the German Air Force at any one time. By 1917, the Pfalz E.I was replaced by more advanced biplane fighters in the Central Powers' Air Services.

    "history": "The Thomas-Morse S-4C was one of the few World War I aircraft independently designed and manufactured in the United States without the assistance or influence of French, British or Italian engineers. While otherwise purely American, it did have a French-designed power plant. A very sturdy aircraft built of wood framing with a fabric covering painted with aluminum colored dope, it had a circular metal cowling surrounding its engine. Built by the Thomas-Morse Aviation Company, the small, compact and aerodynamically sophisticated aircraft was intended to be an advanced trainer for the development of American fighter pilots. \n\nThe S-4C was developed as an alternative to the American built Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\". While the Jenny was probably the finest elementary trainer of its era, its flight characteristics were \"tame\" compared to those of the French S.P.A.D.s, Nieuports and the British Sopwith fighters the American airmen flew in Europe. The United States Army Air Force needed a trainer with properties more closely resembling those of an actual combat fighter. The Thomas-Morse trainer was created to fill this need and began being deployed at flight schools in June of 1917. Since the young airmen who would be flying it had successfully completed their primary training and were certified pilots, the Thomas-Morse trainer had no instructor's cockpit. While not quite possessing the speed and maneuverability of a combat fighter, it approached that degree of performance thus giving the pilot the necessary transitional experience needed before flying \"the real thing\" over the Western Front. \n\nThe machine proved so successful in its role as a transitional advanced trainer that production continued past the end of World War I and was not finally terminated until 1920. A total of 497 S-4Cs were built. and remained in active service at United States Army Air Force flight training schools until the late 1920s. Following their military careers a number of the former trainers were sold on the civilian market where their racy appearance and outstanding performance made them very popular with aerial sportsman. Many hobbyists continued to fly a number of them into the 1950s. While their airframes remained unchanged, those machines flying after the mid 1930s usually had their original rotary engines replaced with more modern radial power plants.",

    "history": "This aircraft was the naval variant of the famous Sopwith Camel. The aircraft received the name \"Camel\" because of the hump-backed area of its forward fuselage, which housed its machine gun. The 2.F.1 Ship Camel differed from the land-based variant in several ways. It had an abbreviated center wing section with a correspondingly shorter lower wing. The 2.F.1 also had only one machine gun mounted in the fuselage instead of the two guns of its land-based counterpart. The Ship Camel's second machine gun was mounted atop its upper wing and fired above the propeller arc. The 2.F.1 also had a more powerful engine, was equipped with arresting gear for landing on an aircraft carrier deck and featured a detachable rear fuselage section to facilitate storage aboard ship. \n\nProduction versions of the 2.F.1 aircraft were built by Sopwith and William Beardmore & Company, which began equipping units of the Royal Naval Air Service in the autumn of 1917. While the \"Naval\" Camel was also deployed from some shore-based facilities, it primarily served aboard the British aircraft carriers <i>Argus</i>, <i>Furious</i>, <i>Pegasus</i> and <i>Eagle</i>, all of which operated with the Grand Fleet. \n\nGiven that Britain was the only World War I combatant nation to field ship-based aircraft, the 2.F.1 Camels, although fighters, faced little aerial opposition during their time at sea. Thus, their role became largely that of reconnaissance aircraft. A squadron of 2.F.1 Camels was also used to launch the first carrier strike in history when seven of the planes, launched from the HMS <i>Furious</i>, attacked the German airship base at Tondern, Germany.\n\nSeveral hundred 2.F.1s were manufactured during the War and remained in active service with the British Royal Navy as carrier-borne fighters for several years after. Some, which were purchased by Canada, remained in shore based service until the late 1920s. The Sopwith 2.F.1 can justly be called the successful forerunner of all shipboard naval aircraft.",

The aircraft is part of a lineage of fighters designed by Louis Bechereau, the chief engineer of the French firm Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Pour L'Aviation et ses D\u00e9riv\u00e9s (SPAD). With its heavy 150 hp (112 kW) inline engine, the SPAD VII was less maneuverable than its opponents. Its robust design, however, allowed it to escape enemy fighters by entering a high speed dive which the Central Powers' lighter built rotary engine fighters could not match. Soon, a more powerful 180 hp (134 kW) engine was added to the SPAD VII's design, improving its performance. This improved version was designated the SPAD VII C1. \n\nMore than 3,800 SPAD VIIs were built in France during the war. England and the Russia constructed hundreds more under license. Most French fighter Escadrilles flew S.VIIs at one time or another from 1916-1917, and many French aces achieved their air victories during World War I while flying a SPAD VII. The air services of England, the United States, Italy, Russia, Poland and Belgium also employed the S.7s.\n\nBy late 1917, Louis Bechereau had again redesigned his machine and produced the improved SPAD XIII. While similar externally to the S.7, the S.13 incorporated a more powerful engine, a slightly greater wingspan, a longer fuselage, and a second machine gun mounted on the nose. The new SPAD XIIIs began replacing the S.7s by the summer of 1917.
