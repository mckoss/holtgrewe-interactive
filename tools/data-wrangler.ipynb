To fulfill this need, the Air Ministry issued a specification for a high performance trainer. George Miles designed the \\\"Master\\\" in response. The new trainer was of smooth aeronautical design and was built of wood. Miles' first prototype, which first flew on June 3, 1937, was rejected by the Air Ministry, but Miles continued on with the project as a private venture. With the need for an advanced trainer becoming ever more pressing, the Royal Air Force finally placed an order in June of 1938 for the Master aircraft, which amounted to over 2 million pounds\\u2014the largest order in RAF history for a trainer. The flight characteristics of the new trainer, which came into RAF service just prior to the beginning of World War II, were quite similar to the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire [both modeled elsewhere in this collection], which were the RAF fighters of that period. All variants of the Master had an instructors' seat in the rear of the cockpit that could be raised so the instructor could look over the head of his student during flight. The machine proved to be excellent in its intended role and its performance was so outstanding that during the dark days following the fall of France when Britain was desperate for fighter aircraft, 24 Masters were modified into single seat fighters with six 0.303 inch machine guns for emergency use. However, none of these were ever used in this role. The model shows the original wing configuration. All variants had the wings clipped in 1942 to reduce stress and improve maneuverability. Including all variants, a total of over 3,200 were manufactured during World War II for use by the Royal Air Force and by Commonwealth Air Forces.\",\n",
